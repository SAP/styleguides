## How to

### How to Get Started with Clean Code

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [How to](#how-to) > [This section](#how-to-get-started-with-clean-code)

If you are new to Clean Code, you should first
read [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_].
The [Clean Code Developer initiative](https://clean-code-developer.com/)
may help you getting started with a didactically smooth stepwise introduction to the topic in general.

We recommend you to start with things that are easily understood and broadly accepted,
such as [Booleans](#booleans), [Conditions](#conditions), and [Ifs](#ifs).

You will probably benefit most from the section [Methods](#methods),
especially [Do one thing, do it well, do it only](#do-one-thing-do-it-well-do-it-only) and [Small](#keep-methods-small),
because these tremendously improve the overall structure of your code.

Some topics in here can spark difficult discussions in teams
that are experienced in what they do but new to Clean Code;
these topics are perfectly "healthy", but people may have problems
making themselves comfortable with them in the beginning.

Continue to these more controversial topics later;
especially [Comments](#comments), [Names](#names), and [Formatting](#formatting)
can lead to near-religious disputes
and should only be addressed by teams that already saw proof of Clean Code's positive effects.

### How to Refactor Legacy Code

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [How to](#how-to) > [This section](#how-to-refactor-legacy-code)

The topics [Booleans](#booleans), [Conditions](#conditions), [Ifs](#ifs),
and [Methods](#methods) are most rewarding if you are working on a legacy project
with tons of code that you cannot or do not want to change
because they can be applied to new code without conflicts.

The topic [Names](#names) is very demanding for legacy projects,
as it may introduce a breach between old and new code,
up to a degree where sections like
[Avoid encodings, esp. Hungarian notation and prefixes](#avoid-encodings-esp-hungarian-notation-and-prefixes)
are better ignored.

Try not to mix different development styles within the same
development object when carrying out a refactoring. If the
legacy code contains only up-front declarations, and a complete
refactoring into using inline declarations is not feasible, it
is probably better to stick with the legacy style rather than
mixing the two styles. There are several similar situations
where mixing styles could cause confusion, for example:

- Mixing `REF TO` and `FIELD-SYMBOL` when looping.
- Mixing `NEW` and `CREATE OBJECT` when calling a `CONSTRUCTOR`.
- Mixing `RETURNING` and `EXPORTING` in the method signatures of
methods only returning / exporting one parameter.

We observed good results with a four-step plan for refactoring:

1. Get the team aboard. Communicate and explain the new style,
and get everybody on the project team to agree to it.
You don't need to commit all guidelines at once, just start
with an undisputed small subset and evolve from there.

2. Follow the _boy scout rule_ to your daily work routine:
_always leave the code you edit a little cleaner than you found it_.
Don't obsess with this by sinking hours into "cleaning the campsite",
just spend a couple of minutes extra and observe how the
improvements accumulate over time.

3. Build _clean islands_: from time to time, pick a small object or component and
try to make it clean in all aspects. These islands demonstrate the benefit
of what you're doing and form solidly tested home bases for further refactoring.

4. Talk about it. No matter whether you set up old-school [Fagan code reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagan_inspection),
hold info sessions, or form discussion boards in your favorite chat tool:
you will need to talk about your experiences and learnings, to enable the
team to grow a common understanding.

### How to Check Automatically

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [How to](#how-to) > [This section](#how-to-check-automatically)

[code pal for ABAP](https://github.com/SAP/code-pal-for-abap)
provides a comprehensive suite of automatic checks for Clean ABAP.

ABAP Test Cockpit, Code Inspector, Extended Check, and Checkman provide
some checks that may help you find certain issues.

[abapOpenChecks](https://github.com/larshp/abapOpenChecks),
an Open Source collection of Code Inspector checks,
also covers some of the described anti-patterns.

[abaplint](https://github.com/abaplint/abaplint) is an open source reimplementation of the ABAP parser. It works without a SAP system and is meant to be used on code serialized using abapGit. It offers multiple integrations (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, text editors...), covers some of the antipatterns and can also be used to check formatting and code conventions.

### How to Relate to Other Guides

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [How to](#how-to) > [This section](#how-to-relate-to-other-guides)

Our guide follows the _spirit_ of Clean Code,
meaning we adjusted some things to the ABAP programming language
e.g. [Throw CX_STATIC_CHECK for manageable exceptions](#throw-cx_static_check-for-manageable-exceptions).

Some facts are from the
[ABAP Programming Guidelines](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_pgl.htm),
which this guide is mostly compatible to; deviations are indicated and always in the spirit of cleaner code.

This guide also respects the
[DSAG's Recommendations for ABAP Development](https://dsag.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dsag_recommendation_abap_development.pdf),
although we are more precise in most details.

Since its publication, Clean ABAP has become a reference guide
for many of SAP's in-house development teams,
including the several hundred coders that work on S/4HANA.

### How to Disagree

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [How to](#how-to) > [This section](#how-to-disagree)

We wrote this style guide for readers who are already acquainted with Clean Code or who are right now working on that,
with a strong focus on how to apply Clean Code _specifically to ABAP_.

Please mind that we therefore did not introduce all concepts in the same length and depth
as the original book and related resources: these are still worth a read,
especially if you disagree with things in here just because we didn't explain them very well.
Use the links in the sections to read up on the background of our guidance.

You are free to discuss and disagree with anything we say here.
One of the pillars of Clean Code is that _the team rules_.
Just be sure to give things a fair chance before you discard them.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) suggests ways how you can change this guide or deviate from it in minor details.

## Names

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#names)

### Use descriptive names

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Names](#names) > [This section](#use-descriptive-names)

Use names that convey the content and meaning of things.

```ABAP
CONSTANTS max_wait_time_in_seconds TYPE i ...
DATA customizing_entries TYPE STANDARD TABLE ...
METHODS read_user_preferences ...
CLASS /clean/user_preference_reader ...
```

Do not focus on the data type or technical encoding.
They hardly contribute to understanding the code.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
CONSTANTS sysubrc_04 TYPE sysubrc ...
DATA iso3166tab TYPE STANDARD TABLE ...
METHODS read_t005 ...
CLASS /dirty/t005_reader ...
```

[Do not attempt to fix bad names by comments.](#comments-are-no-excuse-for-bad-names)

> Read more in _Chapter 2: Meaningful Names: Use Intention-Revealing Names_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_].

### Prefer solution domain and problem domain terms

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Names](#names) > [This section](#prefer-solution-domain-and-problem-domain-terms)

Search for good names in the solution domain, i.e. computer science terms such as "queue" or "tree",
and in the problem domain, i.e. business field terms such as "account" or "ledger".

Layers that are business-like will sound best when named according to the problem domain.
This is especially true for components that are designed with Domain-Driven Design, such as APIs and business objects.

Layers that provide mostly technical functionality, such as factory classes and abstract algorithms,
will sound best when named according to the solution domain.

In any case, do not attempt to make up your own language.
We need to be able to exchange information between developers, product owners, partners and customers,
so choose names that all of these can relate to without a customized dictionary.

> Use Problem Domain Names_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_].

### Use plural

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Names](#names) > [This section](#use-plural)

There is a legacy practice at SAP to name tables of things in singular,
for example `country` for a "table of countries".
Common tendency in the outside world is to use the plural for lists of things.
We therefore recommend to prefer `countries` instead.

### Use pronounceable names

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Names](#names) > [This section](#use-pronounceable-names)

We think and talk a lot about objects, so use names that you can pronounce,
for example prefer `detection_object_types` to something cryptic like `dobjt`.

> Read more in _Chapter 2: Meaningful Names: Use Pronounceable Names_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_]

### Use snake_case
> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Names](#names) > [This section](#use-snake_case)

ABAP is case insensitive which is why we recommend following the convention to use `snake_case` consistently.

There's a character limit for names, e.g. 30 characters for methods. When you reach the maximum length of an object, don't fall back to using `flatcase` or `UPPERCASE`. Try to conscientiously use abbreviations instead (see [Use same abbreviations everywhere](#use-same-abbreviations-everywhere)).

```ABAP
" a variable which contains the maximum reponse time measured in milliseconds
DATA max_response_time_in_millisec TYPE i.
```

is better than

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA maxresponsetimeinmilliseconds TYPE i.
```

### Avoid abbreviations

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Names](#names) > [This section](#avoid-abbreviations)

If you have enough space, write out names in full.
Start abbreviating only if you exceed length limitations.

If you do have to abbreviate, start with the _unimportant_ words.

Abbreviating things may appear efficient at first glance, but becomes ambiguous very fast.
For example, does the "cust" in `cust` mean "customizing", "customer", or "custom"?
All three are common in SAP applications.

> Read more in _Chapter 2: Meaningful Names: Make Meaningful Distinctions_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_].

### Use same abbreviations everywhere

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Names](#names) > [This section](#use-same-abbreviations-everywhere)

People will search for keywords to find relevant code.
Support this by using the same abbreviation for the same thing.
For example, always abbreviate "detection object type" to "dobjt"
instead of mixing "dot", "dotype", "detobjtype" and so on.

> Read more in _Chapter 2: Meaningful Names: Use Searchable Names_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_].

### Use nouns for classes and verbs for methods

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Names](#names) > [This section](#use-nouns-for-classes-and-verbs-for-methods)

Use nouns or noun phrases to name classes, interfaces, and objects:

```ABAP
CLASS /clean/account
CLASS /clean/user_preferences
INTERFACE /clean/customizing_reader
```

Use verbs or verb phrases to name methods:

```ABAP
METHODS withdraw
METHODS add_message
METHODS read_entries
```

Starting Boolean methods with verbs like `is_` and `has_` yields nice reading flow:

```ABAP
IF is_empty( table ).
```

We recommend naming functions like methods:

```ABAP
FUNCTION /clean/read_alerts
```

### Avoid noise words such as "data", "info", "object"

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Names](#names) > [This section](#avoid-noise-words-such-as-data-info-object)

Omit noise words

```ABAP
account  " instead of account_data
alert    " instead of alert_object
```

or replace them with something specific that really adds value

```ABAP
user_preferences          " instead of user_info
response_time_in_seconds  " instead of response_time_variable
```

> Read more in _Chapter 2: Meaningful Names: Make Meaningful Distinctions_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_]

### Pick one word per concept

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Names](#names) > [This section](#pick-one-word-per-concept)

```ABAP
METHODS read_this.
METHODS read_that.
METHODS read_those.
```

Choose a term for a concept and stick to it; don't mix in other synonyms.
Synonyms will make the reader waste time on finding a difference that's not there.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHODS read_this.
METHODS retrieve_that.
METHODS query_those.
```

> Read more in _Chapter 2: Meaningful Names: Pick One Word per Concept_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_]

### Use pattern names only if you mean them

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Names](#names) > [This section](#use-pattern-names-only-if-you-mean-them)

Don't use the names of software design patterns for classes and interfaces unless you really mean them.
For example, don't call your class `file_factory` unless it really implements the factory design pattern.
The most common patterns include:
[singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern),
[factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern),
[facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern),
[composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern),
[decorator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern),
[iterator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern),
[observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern), and
[strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern).

### Avoid encodings, esp. Hungarian notation and prefixes

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Names](#names) > [This section](#avoid-encodings-esp-hungarian-notation-and-prefixes)

We encourage you to get rid of _all_ encoding prefixes.

```ABAP
METHOD add_two_numbers.
  result = a + b.
ENDMETHOD.
```

instead of the needlessly longer

```ABAP
METHOD add_two_numbers.
  rv_result = iv_a + iv_b.
ENDMETHOD.
```

> [Avoid Encodings](sub-sections/AvoidEncodings.md)
> describes the reasoning in depth.

### Avoid obscuring built-in functions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Names](#names) > [This section](#avoid-obscuring-built-in-functions)

Within a class, a built-in function is always obscured by methods of the class if they have the same name, regardless of the number and type of arguments in the function. The function is also obscured regardless of the number and type of method parameters. Built-in functions are, for instance, `condense( )`, `lines( )`, `line_exists( )`, `strlen( )`, etc. 

```ABAP
"anti-pattern
METHODS lines RETURNING VALUE(result) TYPE i.    
METHODS line_exists RETURNING VALUE(result) TYPE i.  
```

```ABAP
"anti-pattern 
CLASS-METHODS condense RETURNING VALUE(result) TYPE i.   
CLASS-METHODS strlen RETURNING VALUE(result) TYPE i.  
```

## Language

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#language)

### Mind the legacy

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Language](#language) > [This section](#mind-the-legacy)

If you code for older ABAP releases, take the advice in this guide with care:
Many recommendations below make use of relatively new syntax and constructs
that may not be supported in older ABAP releases.
Validate the guidelines you want to follow on the oldest release you must support.
Do not simply discard Clean Code as a whole -
the vast majority of rules (e.g. naming, commenting) will work in _any_ ABAP version.

### Mind the performance

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Language](#language) > [This section](#mind-the-performance)

If you code high performance components, take the advice in this guide with care:
Some aspects of Clean Code may make things slower (more method calls) or consume more memory (more objects).
ABAP has some specialties that may intensify this, for example it compares data types when calling a method,
such that splitting a single large method into many sub-methods may make the code slower.

However, we strongly recommend to not optimize prematurely, based on obscure fears.
The vast majority of rules (e.g. naming, commenting) has no negative impact at all.
Try to build things in a clean, object-oriented way.
If something is too slow, make a performance measurement.
Only then should you take a fact-based decision to discard selected rules.

Some further thoughts, taken in part from Chapter 2 of
[Martin Fowler's _Refactoring_](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html):

In a typical application the majority of the runtime is spent in a very small proportion
of the code. As little as 10% of the code can account for 90% of the runtime, and especially
in ABAP a large proportion of runtime is likely to be database time.

Thus it is not the best use of resources to spend significant effort on trying to make _all_
code super-efficient all the time. We're not suggesting ignoring performance, but rather
focus more on clean and well structured code during initial development, and use the
profiler to identify critical areas to optimize.

In fact, we would argue that such an approach will have a net positive effect on performance
because it is a more targeted optimization effort, and it should be easier
to identify performance bottlenecks and easier to refactor and tune well structured code.

### Prefer object orientation to procedural programming

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Language](#language) > [This section](#prefer-object-orientation-to-procedural-programming)

Object-oriented programs (classes, interfaces) are segmented better
and can be refactored and tested more easily than procedural code (functions, programs).
Although there are situations where you must provide procedural objects
(a function for an RFC, a program for a transaction),
these objects should do little more than call a corresponding class that provides the actual feature:

```ABAP
FUNCTION check_business_partner [...].
  DATA(validator) = NEW /clean/biz_partner_validator( ).
  result = validator->validate( business_partners ).
ENDFUNCTION.
```

> [Function Groups vs. Classes](sub-sections/FunctionGroupsVsClasses.md)
> describes the differences in detail.

### Prefer functional to procedural language constructs

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Language](#language) > [This section](#prefer-functional-to-procedural-language-constructs)

They are usually shorter and come more natural to modern programmers.

```ABAP
DATA(variable) = 'A'.
" MOVE 'A' TO variable.

DATA(uppercase) = to_upper( lowercase ).
" TRANSLATE lowercase TO UPPER CASE.

index += 1.         " >= NW 7.54
index = index + 1.  " < NW 7.54
" ADD 1 TO index.

DATA(object) = NEW /clean/my_class( ).
" CREATE OBJECT object TYPE /dirty/my_class.

result = VALUE #( FOR row IN input ( row-text ) ).
" LOOP AT input INTO DATA(row).
"  INSERT row-text INTO TABLE result.
" ENDLOOP.

DATA(line) = value_pairs[ name = 'A' ]. " entry must exist
DATA(line) = VALUE #( value_pairs[ name = 'A' ] OPTIONAL ). " entry can be missing
" READ TABLE value_pairs INTO DATA(line) WITH KEY name = 'A'.

DATA(exists) = xsdbool( line_exists( value_pairs[ name = 'A' ] ) ).
IF line_exists( value_pairs[ name = 'A' ] ).
" READ TABLE value_pairs TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS WITH KEY name = 'A'.
" DATA(exists) = xsdbool( sy-subrc = 0 ).
```

Many of the detailed rules below are just specific reiterations of this general advice.

### Avoid obsolete language elements

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Language](#language) > [This section](#avoid-obsolete-language-elements)

When upgrading your ABAP version,
make sure to check for obsolete language elements
and refrain from using them.

For example, the `@`-escaped "host" variables
in the following statement make a little clearer
what's a program variable and what's a column in the database,

```ABAP
SELECT *
  FROM spfli
  WHERE carrid = @carrid AND
        connid = @connid
  INTO TABLE @itab.
```

as compared to the [obsolete unescaped form](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_750_index_htm/7.50/en-US/abenopen_sql_hostvar_obsolete.htm)

```ABAP
SELECT *
  FROM spfli
  WHERE carrid = carrid AND
        connid = connid
  INTO TABLE itab.
```

Newer alternatives tend to improve readability of the code,
and reduce design conflicts with modern programming paradigms,
such that switching to them can automatically clean your code.

While continuing to work, obsolete elements may stop benefitting
from optimizations in terms of processing speed and memory consumption.

With modern language elements, you can onboard young ABAPers easier,
who may no longer be familiar with the outdated constructs
because they are no longer taught in SAP's trainings.

The SAP NetWeaver documentation contains a stable section
that lists obsolete language elements, for example
[NW 7.50](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_750_index_htm/7.50/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_obsolete.htm),
[NW 7.51](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_751_index_htm/7.51/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_obsolete.htm),
[NW 7.52](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_obsolete.htm),
[NW 7.53](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_obsolete.htm),
[NW 7.54](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_obsolete.htm),
[NW 7.55](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_obsolete.htm),
[NW 7.56](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_obsolete.htm),
[NW 7.57](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_obsolete.htm).

### Use design patterns wisely

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Language](#language) > [This section](#use-design-patterns-wisely)

Where they are appropriate and provide noticeable benefit.
Don't apply design patterns everywhere just for the sake of it.

## Constants

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#constants)

### Use constants instead of magic numbers

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Constants](#constants) > [This section](#use-constants-instead-of-magic-numbers)

```ABAP
IF abap_type = cl_abap_typedescr=>typekind_date.
```

is clearer than

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF abap_type = 'D'.
```

> Read more in _Chapter 17: Smells and Heuristics: G25:
> Replace Magic Numbers with Named Constants_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_].

### Constants also need descriptive names

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Constants](#constants) > [This section](#constants-also-need-descriptive-names)

There is a historic tendency in ABAP to wrap every literal in constants, often with names 
that merely repeat their content or even just their type:
```ABAP
" anti-pattern 
CONSTANTS: 
  c_01 TYPE spart VALUE '01',
  c_mmsta TYPE mmsta VALUE '90'.
```
There is little benefit to either variant. It is not informative for the reader, and if 
the value ever needs to change then a constant named by its value must also be renamed. 

If a coded constant is declared in code then it should describe its meaning not its content.
```ABAP
CONSTANTS status_inactive TYPE mmsta VALUE '90'.
```
It is of course acceptable to repeat the constant's value if it is already descriptive enough: 
```ABAP
CONSTANTS status_cancelled TYPE sww_wistat value 'CANCELLED'.
```

> Note: This section is a specialization of [Use descriptive names](#use-descriptive-names), applied to constants.

### Prefer ENUM to constants interfaces

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Constants](#constants) > [This section](#prefer-enum-to-constants-interfaces)

Use ABAP-native enumerations with `ENUM` (available in releases >= 7.51)

```ABAP
CLASS /clean/message_severity DEFINITION PUBLIC ABSTRACT FINAL.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    TYPES: BEGIN OF ENUM type,
             warning,
             error,
           END OF ENUM type.
ENDCLASS.
```

instead of mixing unrelated things
or misleading people to the conclusion
that constants collections could be "implemented":

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
INTERFACE /dirty/common_constants.
  CONSTANTS:
    warning      TYPE symsgty VALUE 'W',
    transitional TYPE i       VALUE 1,
    error        TYPE symsgty VALUE 'E',
    persisted    TYPE i       VALUE 2.
ENDINTERFACE.
```

> [Enumerations](sub-sections/Enumerations.md)
> describes alternative enumeration patterns (also applicable to older releases that do not support `ENUM` yet)
> and discusses their advantages and disadvantages.
>
> Read more in _Chapter 17: Smells and Heuristics: J3: Constants versus Enums_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_].

### If you don't use ENUM or enumeration patterns, group your constants

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Constants](#constants) > [This section](#if-you-dont-use-enum-or-enumeration-patterns-group-your-constants)

If you cannot use enumerations and have to collect constants in a loose way, for example in an interface, at least group them:

```ABAP
CONSTANTS:
  BEGIN OF message_severity,
    warning TYPE symsgty VALUE 'W',
    error   TYPE symsgty VALUE 'E',
  END OF message_severity,
  BEGIN OF message_lifespan,
    transitional TYPE i VALUE 1,
    persisted    TYPE i VALUE 2,
  END OF message_lifespan.
```

makes the relation clearer than

```ABAP
" Anti-pattern
CONSTANTS:
  warning      TYPE symsgty VALUE 'W',
  transitional TYPE i       VALUE 1,
  error        TYPE symsgty VALUE 'E',
  persisted    TYPE i       VALUE 2,
```

The group also allows you group-wise access, for example for input validation:

```ABAP
DO.
  ASSIGN message_severity-(sy-index) TO FIELD-SYMBOL(<constant>).
  IF sy-subrc IS INITIAL.
    IF input = <constant>.
      DATA(is_valid) = abap_true.
      RETURN.
    ENDIF.
  ELSE.
    RETURN.
  ENDIF.
ENDDO.
```

## Variables

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#variables)

### Prefer inline to up-front declarations

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Variables](#variables) > [This section](#prefer-inline-to-up-front-declarations)

If you follow these guidelines, your methods will become so short (3-5 statements)
that declaring variables inline at first occurrence will look more natural

```ABAP
METHOD do_something.
  DATA(name) = 'something'.
  DATA(reader) = /clean/reader=>get_instance_for( name ).
  result = reader->read_it( ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

than declaring variables with a separate `DATA` section at the beginning of the method

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHOD do_something.
  DATA:
    name   TYPE seoclsname,
    reader TYPE REF TO /dirty/reader.
  name = 'something'.
  reader = /dirty/reader=>get_instance_for( name ).
  result = reader->read_it( ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

> Read more in _Chapter 5: Formatting: Vertical Distance: Variable Declarations_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_].

### Do not use variables outside of the statement block they are declared in

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Variables](#variables) > [This section](#do-not-use-variables-outside-of-the-statement-block-they-are-declared-in)

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF has_entries = abap_true.
  DATA(value) = 1.
ELSE.
  value = 2.
ENDIF.
```

A variable declared in a statement block (like in an `IF` or `LOOP` block) is still available outside of this block in the code that follows it.
This is confusing for readers, especially if the method is longer and the declaration is not spotted immediately.

If the variable is required outside of the statement block it is declared in, declare it beforehand:

```ABAP
DATA value TYPE i.
IF has_entries = abap_true.
  value = 1.
ELSE.
  value = 2.
ENDIF.
```

> Read more in _Chapter 5: Formatting: Vertical Distance: Variable Declarations_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_].

### Do not chain up-front declarations

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Variables](#variables) > [This section](#do-not-chain-up-front-declarations)

```ABAP
DATA name TYPE seoclsname.
DATA reader TYPE REF TO reader.
```

Chaining suggests the defined variables are related on a logical level.
To consistently use it, you would have to ensure that all chained variables belong together,
and introduce additional chain groups to add variables.
While this is possible, it is usually not worth the effort.

Chaining also needlessly complicates reformatting and refactoring
because each line looks different and changing them requires meddling with
colons, dots, and commas, that are not worth the effort.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA:
  name   TYPE seoclsname,
  reader TYPE REF TO reader.
```

> Also refer to [Don't align type clauses](#dont-align-type-clauses)  
> If chaining of data declaration is used, then use one chain for each group of variables belonging together.

### Do not use field symbols for dynamic data access

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Variables](#variables) > [This section](#do-not-use-field-symbols-for-dynamic-data-access)

Starting in ABAP Platform 2021, there are almost no places left where using a field symbol is necessary to perform access to generically typed variables or dynamic access to components of a variable.

So, instead of something like
```ABAP
" anti-pattern
ASSIGN dref->* TO <fs>.
result = <fs>.
```
write
```ABAP
result = dref->*.
```

Refer to [New kinds of ABAP expressions (SAP blog)](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/10/19/new-kinds-of-abap-expressions/) for more examples and detailed explanations of replacing dynamic and generic accesses via field symbols with more modern syntactical constructions.

### Choose the right targets for your loops

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Variables](#variables) > [This section](#choose-the-right-targets-for-your-loops)

There are three possible targets for an ABAP loop: A field symbol (`LOOP AT table ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<line>).`), a reference variable (`LOOP AT table REFERENCE INTO DATA(line).`) or a plain data object (`LOOP AT table INTO DATA(line).`). Each of these have different intended use cases:

 - Field symbols when you want to read or manipulate the data being iterated over. 
 - Data references when you need to access these references outside of the current loop, e.g. pass them into methods whose input parameters are references or keep references to the data around after the loop has finished.
 - Data objects when you need a copy of the data itself or when the line type of the table is already a reference.

Note that data references can be used to read or manipulate the data as well. That is, almost all instances of field symbols as loop targets can be replaced by references as loop targets.

For consistency with the general pattern of object oriented ABAP using references you may wish to use references as loop targets whenever possible. On the other hand, when you want to access the entire value of the line type, using data references introduces additional dereferencing operations that are unnecessary when using field symbols. Compare

```ABAP
LOOP AT table ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<line>).
  obj->do_something( <line> ).
ENDLOOP.
```

to

```ABAP
LOOP AT table REFERENCE INTO DATA(line).
  obj->do_something( line->* ).
ENDLOOP.
```

Additionally, data access via field symbols is slightly faster than data access via references. This is only noticable when loops make up a significant part of the runtime of the program and is often not relevant, e.g. when database operations or other input/output processes dominate the runtime.

For these reasons, there are two possible consistent styles depending on the specific application context:

 - If the context mostly uses objects and references otherwise, and if small performance hits in loops are not generally relevant, use references instead of field symbols as loop targets whenever possible.
 - If the context performs a lot of manipulation of plain data and not references or objects, or if small performance hits in loops are generally relevant, use field symbols to read and manipulate data in loops.

## Tables

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#tables)

### Use the right table type

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Tables](#tables) > [This section](#use-the-right-table-type)

- You typically use `HASHED` tables for **large tables**
that are **filled in a single step**, **never modified**, and **read often by their key**.
Their inherent memory and processing overhead makes hash tables only valuable
for large amounts of data and lots of read accesses.
Each change to the table's content requires expensive recalculation of the hash,
so don't use this for tables that are modified too often.

- You typically use `SORTED` tables for **large tables**
that need to be **sorted at all times**, that are **filled bit by bit** or **need to be modified**,
and **read often by one or more full or partial keys** or processed **in a certain order**.
Adding, changing, or removing content requires finding the right insertion spot,
but doesn't require adjusting the rest of the table's index.
Sorted tables demonstrate their value only for large numbers of read accesses.

- Use `STANDARD` tables for **small tables**, where indexing produces more overhead than benefit, and **"arrays"**, where you either don't care at all for the order of the rows, or you want to process them in exactly the order they were appended. Also, if different access to the table is needed e.g. indexed access and sorted access via `SORT` and `BINARY SEARCH`.

> These are only rough guidelines.

### Avoid DEFAULT KEY

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Tables](#tables) > [This section](#avoid-default-key)

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA itab TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF row_type WITH DEFAULT KEY.
```

Default keys are often only added to get the newer functional statements working.
The keys themselves in fact are usually superfluous and waste resources for nothing.
They can even lead to obscure mistakes because they ignore numeric data types.
The `SORT` and `DELETE ADJACENT` statements without explicit field list will resort to the primary key of the
 internal table, which in case of usage of `DEFAULT KEY` can lead to very unexpected results when having
 e.g. numeric fields as component of the key, in particular in combination with `READ TABLE ... BINARY` etc.

Either specify the key components explicitly

```ABAP
DATA itab2 TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF row_type WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY comp1 comp2.
```

or resort to `EMPTY KEY` if you don't need a key at all.

```ABAP
DATA itab1 TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF row_type WITH EMPTY KEY.
```

> Following [Horst Keller's blog on _Internal Tables with Empty Key_](https://blogs.sap.com/2013/06/27/abap-news-for-release-740-internal-tables-with-empty-key/)
> 
> **Caution:** `SORT` on internal tables with `EMPTY KEY` (without explicit sort fields) will not sort at all,

### Prefer INSERT INTO TABLE to APPEND TO

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Tables](#tables) > [This section](#prefer-insert-into-table-to-append-to)

```ABAP
INSERT VALUE #( ... ) INTO TABLE itab.
```

`INSERT INTO TABLE` works with all table and key types,
thus making it easier for you to refactor the table's type and key definitions if your performance requirements change.

Use `APPEND TO` only if you use a `STANDARD` table in an array-like fashion,
if you want to stress that the added entry shall be the last row.

### Prefer LINE_EXISTS to READ TABLE or LOOP AT

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Tables](#tables) > [This section](#prefer-line_exists-to-read-table-or-loop-at)

```ABAP
IF line_exists( my_table[ key = 'A' ] ).
```

expresses the intent clearer and shorter than

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
READ TABLE my_table TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS WITH KEY key = 'A'.
IF sy-subrc = 0.
```

or even

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
LOOP AT my_table REFERENCE INTO DATA(line) WHERE key = 'A'.
  line_exists = abap_true.
  EXIT.
ENDLOOP.
```

### Prefer READ TABLE to LOOP AT

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Tables](#tables) > [This section](#prefer-read-table-to-loop-at)

```ABAP
READ TABLE my_table REFERENCE INTO DATA(line) WITH KEY key = 'A'.
```

expresses the intent clearer and shorter than

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
LOOP AT my_table REFERENCE INTO DATA(line) WHERE key = 'A'.
  EXIT.
ENDLOOP.
```

or even

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
LOOP AT my_table REFERENCE INTO DATA(line).
  IF line->key = 'A'.
    EXIT.
  ENDIF.
ENDLOOP.
```

### Prefer LOOP AT WHERE to nested IF

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Tables](#tables) > [This section](#prefer-loop-at-where-to-nested-if)

```ABAP
LOOP AT my_table REFERENCE INTO DATA(line) WHERE key = 'A'.
```

expresses the intent clearer and shorter than

```ABAP
LOOP AT my_table REFERENCE INTO DATA(line).
  IF line->key = 'A'.
    EXIT.
  ENDIF.
ENDLOOP.
```

### Avoid unnecessary table reads

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Tables](#tables) > [This section](#avoid-unnecessary-table-reads)

In case you _expect_ a row to be there,
read once and react to the exception,

```ABAP
TRY.
    DATA(row) = my_table[ key = input ].
  CATCH cx_sy_itab_line_not_found.
    RAISE EXCEPTION NEW /clean/my_data_not_found( ).
ENDTRY.
```

instead of littering and slowing down
the main control flow with a double read

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF NOT line_exists( my_table[ key = input ] ).
  RAISE EXCEPTION NEW /clean/my_data_not_found( ).
ENDIF.
DATA(row) = my_table[ key = input ].
```

## Strings

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#strings)

### Use ` to define literals

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Strings](#strings) > [This section](#use--to-define-literals)

```ABAP
CONSTANTS some_constant TYPE string VALUE `ABC`.
DATA(some_string) = `ABC`.  " --> TYPE string
```

Refrain from using `'`, as it adds a superfluous type conversion and confuses the reader
whether he's dealing with a `CHAR` or `STRING`:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA some_string TYPE string.
some_string = 'ABC'.
```

`|` is generally okay, but cannot be used for `CONSTANTS` and adds needless overhead when specifying a fixed value:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA(some_string) = |ABC|.
```

### Use | to assemble text

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Strings](#strings) > [This section](#use--to-assemble-text)

```ABAP
DATA(message) = |Received HTTP code { status_code } with message { text }|.
```

String templates highlight better what's literal and what's variable,
especially if you embed multiple variables in a text.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA(message) = `Received an unexpected HTTP ` && status_code && ` with message ` && text.
```

## Booleans

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#booleans)

### Use Booleans wisely

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Booleans](#booleans) > [This section](#use-booleans-wisely)

We often encounter cases where Booleans seem to be a natural choice

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
is_archived = abap_true.
```

until a change of viewpoint suggests
we should have chosen an enumeration

```ABAP
archiving_status = /clean/archivation_status=>archiving_in_process.
```

Generally, Booleans are a bad choice
to distinguish types of things
because you will nearly always encounter cases
that are not exclusively one or the other

```ABAP
assert_true( xsdbool( document->is_archived( ) = abap_true AND
                      document->is_partially_archived( ) = abap_true ) ).
```

[Split method instead of Boolean input parameter](#split-method-instead-of-boolean-input-parameter)
moreover explains why you should always challenge Boolean parameters.

### Use ABAP_BOOL for Booleans

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Booleans](#booleans) > [This section](#use-abap_bool-for-booleans)

```ABAP
DATA has_entries TYPE abap_bool.
```

Don't use the generic type `char1`.
Although it is technically compatible it obscures the fact that we're dealing with a Boolean variable.

Also avoid other Boolean types as they often have strange side effects,
for example `boolean` supports a third value "undefined" that results in subtle programming errors.

In some cases you may need a data dictionary element, for example for DynPro fields.
`abap_bool` cannot be used here because it is defined in the type pool `abap`, not in the data dictionary.
In this case, resort to `abap_boolean`.
Create your own data element if you need a custom description.

> ABAP may be the one single programming language that does not come with a universal Boolean data type.
> However, having one is imperative.
> This recommendation is based on the ABAP Programming Guidelines.

### Use ABAP_TRUE and ABAP_FALSE for comparisons

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Booleans](#booleans) > [This section](#use-abap_true-and-abap_false-for-comparisons)

```ABAP
has_entries = abap_true.
IF has_entries = abap_false.
```

Don't use the character equivalents `'X'` and `' '` or `space`;
they make it hard to see that this is a Boolean expression:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
has_entries = 'X'.
IF has_entries = space.
```

Avoid comparisons with `INITIAL` - it forces readers to recollect that `abap_bool`'s default is `abap_false`:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF has_entries IS NOT INITIAL.
```

> ABAP may be the one single programming language that does not come with built-in "constants" for true and false.
> However, having them is imperative.
> This recommendation is based on the ABAP Programming Guidelines.

### Use XSDBOOL to set Boolean variables

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Booleans](#booleans) > [This section](#use-xsdbool-to-set-boolean-variables)

```ABAP
DATA(has_entries) = xsdbool( line IS NOT INITIAL ).
```

The equivalent `IF`-`THEN`-`ELSE` is much longer for nothing:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF line IS INITIAL.
  has_entries = abap_false.
ELSE.
  has_entries = abap_true.
ENDIF.
```

`xsdbool` is the best method for our purpose, as it directly produces a `char1`,
which fits our boolean type `abap_bool` best.
The equivalent functions `boolc` and `boolx` produce different types
and add an unnecessary implicit type conversion.

We agree that the name `xsdbool` is unlucky and misleading;
after all, we're not at all interested in the "XML Schema Definition" parts that the "xsd" prefix suggests.

A possible alternative to `xsdbool` is the `COND` ternary form.
Its syntax is intuitive, but a little longer because it needlessly repeats the `THEN abap_true` segment,
and requires knowledge of the implicit default value `abap_false` -
which is why we suggest it only as secondary solution.

```ABAP
DATA(has_entries) = COND abap_bool( WHEN line IS NOT INITIAL THEN abap_true ).
```

## Conditions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#conditions)

### Try to make conditions positive

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Conditions](#conditions) > [This section](#try-to-make-conditions-positive)

```ABAP
IF has_entries = abap_true.
```

For comparison, see how hard to understand the same statement gets by reversing it:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF has_no_entries = abap_false.
```

The "try" in the section title means you shouldn't force this
up to the point where you end up with something like [empty IF branches](#no-empty-if-branches):

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF has_entries = abap_true.
ELSE.
  " only do something in the ELSE block, IF remains empty
ENDIF.
```

### Prefer IS NOT to NOT IS

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Conditions](#conditions) > [This section](#prefer-is-not-to-not-is)

```ABAP
IF variable IS NOT INITIAL.
IF variable NP 'TODO*'.
IF variable <> 42.
```

Negation is logically equivalent
but requires a "mental turnaround"
that makes it harder to understand.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF NOT variable IS INITIAL.
IF NOT variable CP 'TODO*'.
IF NOT variable = 42.
```

### Consider using predicative method calls for boolean methods

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Conditions](#conditions) > [This section](#consider-using-predicative-method-calls-for-boolean-methods)

The predicative method call for boolean methods, e.g.

```ABAP
IF [ NOT ] condition_is_fulfilled( ).
```

is not just very compact, but it also allows to keep the code closer to natural language as the comparison expression:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF condition_is_fulfilled( ) = abap_true / abap_false.
```

Mind that the predicative method call `... meth( ) ...` is just a short form of `... meth( ) IS NOT INITIAL ...`, see [Predicative Method Call](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenpredicative_method_calls.htm) in the ABAP Keyword Documentation. This is why the short form should only be used for methods returning types where the non-initial value has the meaning of "true" and the initial value has the meaning of "false".

### Consider decomposing complex conditions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Conditions](#conditions) > [This section](#consider-decomposing-complex-conditions)

Conditions can become easier when decomposing them into the elementary parts that make them up:

```ABAP
DATA(example_provided) = xsdbool( example_a IS NOT INITIAL OR
                                  example_b IS NOT INITIAL ).

DATA(one_example_fits) = xsdbool( applies( example_a ) = abap_true OR
                                  applies( example_b ) = abap_true OR
                                  fits( example_b ) = abap_true ).

IF example_provided = abap_true AND
   one_example_fits = abap_true.
```

instead of leaving everything in-place:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF ( example_a IS NOT INITIAL OR
     example_b IS NOT INITIAL ) AND
   ( applies( example_a ) = abap_true OR
     applies( example_b ) = abap_true OR
     fits( example_b ) = abap_true ).
```

> Use the ABAP Development Tools quick fixes to quickly extract conditions and create variables as shown above.

### Consider extracting complex conditions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Conditions](#conditions) > [This section](#consider-extracting-complex-conditions)

It's nearly always a good idea to extract complex conditions to methods of their own:

```ABAP
IF is_provided( example ).

METHOD is_provided.
  DATA(is_filled) = xsdbool( example IS NOT INITIAL ).
  DATA(is_working) = xsdbool( applies( example ) = abap_true OR
                              fits( example ) = abap_true ).
  result = xsdbool( is_filled = abap_true AND
                    is_working = abap_true ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

## Ifs

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#ifs)

### No empty IF branches

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Ifs](#ifs) > [This section](#no-empty-if-branches)

```ABAP
IF has_entries = abap_false.
  " do some magic
ENDIF.
```

is shorter and clearer than

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF has_entries = abap_true.
ELSE.
  " do some magic
ENDIF.
```

### Prefer CASE to ELSE IF for multiple alternative conditions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Ifs](#ifs) > [This section](#prefer-case-to-else-if-for-multiple-alternative-conditions)

```ABAP
CASE type.
  WHEN type-some_type.
    " ...
  WHEN type-some_other_type.
    " ...
  WHEN OTHERS.
    RAISE EXCEPTION NEW /clean/unknown_type_failure( ).
ENDCASE.
```

`CASE` makes it easy to see a set of alternatives that exclude each other.
It can be faster than a series of `IF`s because it can translate to a different microprocessor command
instead of a series of subsequently evaluated conditions.
You can introduce new cases quickly, without having to repeat the discerning variable over and over again.
The statement even prevents some errors that can occur when accidentally nesting the `IF`-`ELSEIF`s.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF type = type-some_type.
  " ...
ELSEIF type = type-some_other_type.
  " ...
ELSE.
  RAISE EXCEPTION NEW /dirty/unknown_type_failure( ).
ENDIF.
```

### Keep the nesting depth low

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Ifs](#ifs) > [This section](#keep-the-nesting-depth-low)

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF <this>.
  IF <that>.
  ENDIF.
ELSE.
  IF <other>.
  ELSE.
    IF <something>.
    ENDIF.
  ENDIF.
ENDIF.
```

Nested `IF`s get hard to understand very quickly and require an exponential number of test cases for complete coverage.

Decision trees can usually be taken apart by forming sub-methods and introducing boolean helper variables.

Other cases can be simplified by merging IFs, such as

```ABAP
IF <this> AND <that>.
```

instead of the needlessly nested

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF <this>.
  IF <that>.
```

## Regular expressions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#regular-expressions)

### Prefer simpler methods to regular expressions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Regular expressions](#regular-expressions) > [This section](#prefer-simpler-methods-to-regular-expressions)

```ABAP
IF input IS NOT INITIAL.
" IF matches( val = input  regex = '.+' ).

WHILE contains( val = input  sub = 'abc' ).
" WHILE contains( val = input  regex = 'abc' ).
```

Regular expressions become hard to understand very quickly.
Simple cases are usually easier without them.

Regular expressions also usually consume more memory and processing time
because they need to be parsed into an expression tree and compiled at runtime into an executable matcher.
Simple solutions may do with a straight-forward loop and a temporary variable.

### Prefer basis checks to regular expressions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Regular expressions](#regular-expressions) > [This section](#prefer-basis-checks-to-regular-expressions)

```ABAP
CALL FUNCTION 'SEO_CLIF_CHECK_NAME'
  EXPORTING
    cls_name = class_name
  EXCEPTIONS
    ...
```

instead of reinventing things

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA(is_valid) = matches( val     = class_name
                          pattern = '[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{0,29}' ).
```

> when there are regular expressions around,
> compare section _Chapter 17: Smells and Heuristics: General: G5: Duplication_ in [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_].

### Consider assembling complex regular expressions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Regular expressions](#regular-expressions) > [This section](#consider-assembling-complex-regular-expressions)

```ABAP
CONSTANTS class_name TYPE string VALUE `CL\_.*`.
CONSTANTS interface_name TYPE string VALUE `IF\_.*`.
DATA(object_name) = |{ class_name }\|{ interface_name }|.
```

Some complex regular expressions become easier
when you demonstrate to the reader how they are built up from more elementary pieces.

## Classes

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#classes)

### Classes: Object orientation

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [This section](#classes-object-orientation)

#### Prefer objects to static classes

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [Classes: Object orientation](#classes-object-orientation) > [This section](#prefer-objects-to-static-classes)

Static classes give up all advantages gained by object orientation in the first place.
They especially make it nearly impossible to replace dependencies with test doubles in unit tests.

If you think about whether to make a class or method static, the answer will nearly always be: no.

One accepted exception to this rule are plain type utils classes.
Their methods make it easier to interact with certain ABAP types.
They are not only completely stateless, but so basic that they look like ABAP statements or built-in functions.
The discriminating factor is that their consumers tie them into their code so tightly
that they actually don't want to mock them in unit tests.

```ABAP
CLASS /clean/string_utils DEFINITION [...].
  CLASS-METHODS trim
   IMPORTING
     string        TYPE string
   RETURNING
     VALUE(result) TYPE string.
ENDCLASS.

METHOD retrieve.
  DATA(trimmed_name) = /clean/string_utils=>trim( name ).
  result = read( trimmed_name ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

#### Prefer composition to inheritance

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [Classes: Object orientation](#classes-object-orientation) > [This section](#prefer-composition-to-inheritance)

Avoid building hierarchies of classes with inheritance. Instead, favor composition.

Clean inheritance is hard to design because you need to respect rules
like the [Liskov substitution principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle).
It is also hard to understand because people need to realize and digest the guiding principles behind the hierarchy.
Inheritance reduces reuse because methods tend to be made available only to sub-classes.
It also complicates refactoring because moving or changing members tend to require changes to the whole hierarchy tree.

Composition means that you design small, independent objects, each of which serves one specific purpose.
These objects can be recombined into more complex objects by simple delegation and facade patterns.
Composition may produce more classes, but has otherwise no further disadvantages.

Don't let this rule discourage you from using inheritance in the right places.
There are good applications for inheritance,
for example the [Composite design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern).
Just ask yourself critically whether inheritance in your case will really provide more benefits than disadvantages.
If in doubt, composition generally is the safer choice.

compares some details.

#### Don't mix stateful and stateless in the same class

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [Classes: Object orientation](#classes-object-orientation)

Don't mix the stateless and the stateful
programming paradigms in the same class.

In stateless programming, methods get input and produce output,
_without any side effects_, resulting in methods
that produce the same result
no matter when and in what order they are called.

```ABAP
CLASS /clean/xml_converter DEFINITION PUBLIC FINAL CREATE PUBLIC.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS convert
      IMPORTING
        file_content  TYPE xstring
      RETURNING
        VALUE(result) TYPE /clean/some_inbound_message.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS /clean/xml_converter IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD convert.
    cl_proxy_xml_transform=>xml_xstring_to_abap(
      EXPORTING
        xml       = file_content
        ext_xml   = abap_true
        svar_name = 'ROOT_NODE'
      IMPORTING
        abap_data = result ).
   ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
```

In stateful programming, we manipulate the internal state of objects
through their methods, meaning it is _full of side effects_.

```ABAP
CLASS /clean/log DEFINITION PUBLIC CREATE PUBLIC.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS add_message IMPORTING message TYPE /clean/message.
  PRIVATE SECTION.
    DATA messages TYPE /clean/message_table.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS /clean/log IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD add_message.
    INSERT message INTO TABLE messages.
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
```

Both paradigms are okay and have their applications.
However, _mixing_ them in the same object produces code
that is hard to understand and sure to fail
with obscure carry-over errors and synchronicity problems.
Don't do that.

### Scope

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [This section](#scope)

#### Global by default, local only where appropriate

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [Scope](#scope) > [This section](#global-by-default-local-only-where-appropriate)

Work with global classes as default.
Use local classes only where appropriate.

> Global classes are the ones that are visible in the data dictionary.
> Local classes live within an include of another development object
> and are only visible to this other object.

Local classes are suited

- for very specific private data structures,
for example an iterator for the global class's data,
which will only ever be needed here,

- to extract a complex private piece algorithm,
for example to disentangle that special purpose multi-method
sort-aggregate algorithm from the rest of your class's code,

- to enable mocking certain aspects of the global class,
for example by extracing all database access to a separate local class
that can the be replaced with a test double in the unit tests.

Local classes hinder reuse because they cannot be used elsewhere.
Although they are easy to extract, people will usually fail to even find them,
leading to undesired code duplication.
Orientation, navigation, and debugging in very long local class includes
is tedious and annoying. 
As ABAP locks on include level, people will not be able to work on
different parts of the local include simultaneously
(which would be possible if they were separate global classes).

Reconsider your use of local classes if

- your local include spans dozens of classes and thousands of lines of code,
- you think about global classes as "packages" that hold other classes,
- your global classes degenerate into empty hulls,
- you find duplicate code repeated throughout separate local includes,
- your developers start locking each other out and become unable to work in parallel,
- your backlog estimates go sky-high because your teams fail to understand each other's local sub-trees.

#### FINAL if not designed for inheritance

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [Scope](#scope) > [This section](#final-if-not-designed-for-inheritance)

Make classes that are not explicitly designed for inheritance `FINAL`.

When designing class cooperation,
your first choice should be [composition, not inheritance](#prefer-composition-to-inheritance).
Enabling inheritance is not something that should be done lightly,
as it requires you to think about things like `PROTECTED` vs. `PRIVATE`
and the [Liskov substitution principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle),
and freezes a lot of design internals.
If you didn't consider these things in your class design,
you should thus prevent accidental inheritance by making your class `FINAL`.

There _are_ some good applications for inheritance, of course,
for example the design pattern [composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern).
Business Add-Ins can also become more useful by allowing sub-classes,
enabling the customer to reuse most of the original code.
However, note that all of these cases have inheritance built in by design from the start.

Unclean classes that don't [implement interfaces](#public-instance-methods-should-be-part-of-an-interface)
should be left non-`FINAL` to allow consumers mocking them in their unit tests.

#### Members PRIVATE by default, PROTECTED only if needed

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [Scope](#scope) > [This section](#members-private-by-default-protected-only-if-needed)

Make attributes, methods, and other class members `PRIVATE` by default.

Make them only `PROTECTED` if you want to enable sub-classes that override them.

Internals of classes should be made available to others only on a need-to-know basis.
This includes not only outside callers but also sub-classes.
Making information over-available can cause subtle errors by unexpected redefinitions and hinder refactoring
because outsiders freeze members in place that should still be liquid.

#### Consider using immutable instead of getter

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [Scope](#scope) > [This section](#consider-using-immutable-instead-of-getter)

An immutable is an object that never changes after its construction.
For this kind of object consider using public read-only attributes instead of getter methods.

```ABAP
CLASS /clean/some_data_container DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS constructor
      IMPORTING
        a TYPE i
        b TYPE c
        c TYPE d.
    DATA a TYPE i READ-ONLY.
    DATA b TYPE c READ-ONLY.
    DATA c TYPE d READ-ONLY.
ENDCLASS.
```

instead of

```ABAP
CLASS /dirty/some_data_container DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS get_a ...
    METHODS get_b ...
    METHODS get_c ...
  PRIVATE SECTION.
    DATA a TYPE i.
    DATA b TYPE c.
    DATA c TYPE d.
ENDCLASS.
```

> **Caution**: For objects which **do** have changing values, do not use public read-only attributes.
> Otherwise this attributes always have to be kept up to date,
> regardless if their value is needed by any other code or not.

#### Use READ-ONLY sparingly

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [Scope](#scope) > [This section](#use-read-only-sparingly)

Many modern programming languages, especially Java, recommend making class members read-only
wherever appropriate to prevent accidental side effects.

While ABAP _does_ offer the `READ-ONLY` addition for data declarations, we recommend to use it sparingly.

First, the addition is only available in the `PUBLIC SECTION`, reducing its applicability drastically.
You can neither add it to protected or private members nor to local variables in a method.

Second, the addition works subtly different from what people might expect from other programming languages:
READ-ONLY data can still be modified freely from any method within the class itself, its friends, and its sub-classes.
This contradicts the more widespread write-once-modify-never behavior found in other languages.
The difference may lead to bad surprises.

> To avoid misunderstandings: Protecting variables against accidental modification is a good practice.
> We would recommend applying it to ABAP as well if there was an appropriate statement.

### Constructors

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [This section](#constructors)

#### Prefer NEW to CREATE OBJECT

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [Constructors](#constructors) > [This section](#prefer-new-to-create-object)

```ABAP
DATA object TYPE REF TO /clean/some_number_range.
object = NEW #( '/CLEAN/CXTGEN' )
...
DATA(object) = NEW /clean/some_number_range( '/CLEAN/CXTGEN' ).
...
DATA(object) = CAST /clean/number_range( NEW /clean/some_number_range( '/CLEAN/CXTGEN' ) ).
```

instead of the needlessly longer

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA object TYPE REF TO /dirty/some_number_range.
CREATE OBJECT object
  EXPORTING
    number_range = '/DIRTY/CXTGEN'.
```

except where you need dynamic types, of course

```ABAP
CREATE OBJECT number_range TYPE (dynamic_type)
  EXPORTING
    number_range = '/CLEAN/CXTGEN'.
```

#### If your global class is CREATE PRIVATE, leave the CONSTRUCTOR public

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [Constructors](#constructors) > [This section](#if-your-global-class-is-create-private-leave-the-constructor-public)

```ABAP
CLASS /clean/some_api DEFINITION PUBLIC FINAL CREATE PRIVATE.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS constructor.
```

We agree that this contradicts itself.
However, according to the article
[_Instance Constructor_ of the ABAP Help](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abeninstance_constructor_guidl.htm),
specifying the `CONSTRUCTOR` in the `PUBLIC SECTION` is required to guarantee correct compilation and syntax validation.

This applies only to global classes.
In local classes, make the constructor private, as it should be.

#### Prefer multiple static creation methods to optional parameters

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [Constructors](#constructors) > [This section](#prefer-multiple-static-creation-methods-to-optional-parameters)

```ABAP
CLASS-METHODS describe_by_data IMPORTING data TYPE any [...]
CLASS-METHODS describe_by_name IMPORTING name TYPE any [...]
CLASS-METHODS describe_by_object_ref IMPORTING object_ref TYPE REF TO object [...]
CLASS-METHODS describe_by_data_ref IMPORTING data_ref TYPE REF TO data [...]
```

ABAP does not support [overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading).
Use name variations and not optional parameters to achieve the desired semantics.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHODS constructor
  IMPORTING
    data       TYPE any OPTIONAL
    name       TYPE any OPTIONAL
    object_ref TYPE REF TO object OPTIONAL
    data_ref   TYPE REF TO data OPTIONAL
  [...]
```

The general guideline
[_Split methods instead of adding OPTIONAL parameters_](#split-methods-instead-of-adding-optional-parameters)
explains the reasoning behind this.

Consider resolving complex constructions to a multi-step construction with the
[Builder design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern).

#### Use descriptive names for multiple creation methods

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [Constructors](#constructors) > [This section](#use-descriptive-names-for-multiple-creation-methods)

Good words to start creation methods are `new_`, `create_`, and `construct_`.
People intuitively connect them to the construction of objects.
They also add up nicely to verb phrases like `new_from_template`, `create_as_copy`, or `create_by_name`.

```ABAP
CLASS-METHODS new_describe_by_data IMPORTING p_data TYPE any [...]
CLASS-METHODS new_describe_by_name IMPORTING p_name TYPE any [...]
CLASS-METHODS new_describe_by_object_ref IMPORTING p_object_ref TYPE REF TO object [...]
CLASS-METHODS new_describe_by_data_ref IMPORTING p_data_ref TYPE REF TO data [...]
```

instead of something meaningless like

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
CLASS-METHODS create_1 IMPORTING p_data TYPE any [...]
CLASS-METHODS create_2 IMPORTING p_name TYPE any [...]
CLASS-METHODS create_3 IMPORTING p_object_ref TYPE REF TO object [...]
CLASS-METHODS create_4 IMPORTING p_data_ref TYPE REF TO data [...]
```

#### Make singletons only where multiple instances don't make sense

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Classes](#classes) > [Constructors](#constructors) > [This section](#make-singletons-only-where-multiple-instances-dont-make-sense)

```ABAP
METHOD new.
  IF singleton IS NOT BOUND.
    singleton = NEW /clean/my_class( ).
  ENDIF.
  result = singleton.
ENDMETHOD.
```

Apply the singleton pattern where your object-oriented design says
that having a second instance of something doesn't make sense.
Use it to ensure that every consumer is working with the same thing in the same state and with the same data.

Do not use the singleton pattern out of habit or because some performance rule tells you so.
It is the most overused and wrongly applied pattern and
produces unexpected cross-effects and needlessly complicates testing.
If there are no design-driven reasons for a unitary object,
leave that decision to the consumer - he can still reach the same by means outside the constructor,
for example with a factory.

## Methods

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#methods)

These rules apply to methods in classes and function modules.

### Calls

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [This section](#calls)

#### Don't call static methods through instance variables

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Calls](#calls) > [This section](#dont-call-static-methods-through-instance-variables)

For calling a static method, use
```ABAP
cl_my_class=>static_method( ).
```

Instead of calling it through an instance variable to `cl_my_class`
```ABAP
" anti-pattern
lo_my_instance->static_method( ).
```

A static method is attached to the class itself, and calling it through an instance variable is a potential source of confusion.

It's OK to call a static method of the same class without qualifying it within another static method.

```ABAP
METHOD static_method.
  another_static_method( ).
  yet_another( ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

However, within an instance method, even when calling a static method of the same class, you should still qualify the call with the class name:

```ABAP
CLASS cl_my_class IMPLEMENTATION.

  METHOD instance_method.
    cl_my_class=>a_static_method( ).
    another_instance_method( ).
  ENDMETHOD.

  ...
```

#### Don't access types through instance variables

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Calls](#calls) > [This section](#dont-access-types-through-instance-variables)

When using a data type that is defined in a class or interface, access the type definition via the class/interface and not via an instance of the class/interface. 

```ABAP
CLASS lcl DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    TYPES foo TYPE i.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS lcl IMPLEMENTATION.
ENDCLASS.

INTERFACE lif.
  TYPES blah TYPE lcl=>foo.  
ENDINTERFACE.
```

Using the instance for the data type would be confusing, as it suggests that the type is instance specific. 

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
CLASS lcl DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    TYPES foo TYPE i.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS lcl IMPLEMENTATION.
ENDCLASS.

INTERFACE lif.
  DATA(ref) = new lcl( ).
  TYPES blah TYPE ref->foo.
ENDINTERFACE.
```

#### Prefer functional to procedural calls

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Calls](#calls) > [This section](#prefer-functional-to-procedural-calls)

```ABAP
modify->update( node           = /clean/my_bo_c=>node-item
                key            = item->key
                data           = item
                changed_fields = changed_fields ).
```

instead of the needlessly longer

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
CALL METHOD modify->update
  EXPORTING
    node           = /dirty/my_bo_c=>node-item
    key            = item->key
    data           = item
    changed_fields = changed_fields.
```

If dynamic typing forbids functional calls, resort to the procedural style

```ABAP
CALL METHOD modify->(method_name)
  EXPORTING
    node           = /clean/my_bo_c=>node-item
    key            = item->key
    data           = item
    changed_fields = changed_fields.
```

Many of the detailed rules below are just more specific variations of this advice.

#### Omit RECEIVING

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Calls](#calls) > [This section](#omit-receiving)

```ABAP
DATA(sum) = aggregate_values( values ).
```

instead of the needlessly longer

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
aggregate_values(
  EXPORTING
    values = values
  RECEIVING
    result = DATA(sum) ).
```

#### Omit the optional keyword EXPORTING

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Calls](#calls) > [This section](#omit-the-optional-keyword-exporting)

```ABAP
modify->update( node           = /clean/my_bo_c=>node-item
                key            = item->key
                data           = item
                changed_fields = changed_fields ).
```

instead of the needlessly longer

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
modify->update(
  EXPORTING
    node           = /dirty/my_bo_c=>node-item
    key            = item->key
    data           = item
    changed_fields = changed_fields ).
```

#### Omit the parameter name in single parameter calls

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Calls](#calls) > [This section](#omit-the-parameter-name-in-single-parameter-calls)

```ABAP
DATA(unique_list) = remove_duplicates( list ).
```

instead of the needlessly longer

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA(unique_list) = remove_duplicates( list = list ).
```

There are cases, however, where the method name alone is not clear enough
and repeating the parameter name may further understandability:

```ABAP
car->drive( speed = 50 ).
update( asynchronous = abap_true ).
```

#### Omit the self-reference me when calling an instance attribute or method

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Calls](#calls) > [This section](#omit-the-self-reference-me-when-calling-an-instance-attribute-or-method)

Since the self-reference `me->` is implicitly set by the system, omit it when calling an instance attribute or method

```ABAP
DATA(sum) = aggregate_values( values ).
```

instead of the needlessly longer

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA(sum) = aggregate_values( me->values ).
```

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA(sum) = me->aggregate_values( values ).
```

unless there is a scope conflict between a local variable or importing parameter and an instance attribute

```ABAP
me->logger = logger.
```

### Methods: Object orientation

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [This section](#methods-object-orientation)

#### Prefer instance to static methods

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Methods: Object orientation](#methods-object-orientation) > [This section](#prefer-instance-to-static-methods)

Methods should be instance members by default.
Instance methods better reflect the "object-hood" of the class.
They can be mocked easier in unit tests.

```ABAP
METHODS publish.
```

Methods should be static only in exceptional cases, such as static creation methods.

```ABAP
CLASS-METHODS create_instance
  RETURNING
    VALUE(result) TYPE REF TO /clean/blog_post.
```

#### Public instance methods should be part of an interface

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Methods: Object orientation](#methods-object-orientation) > [This section](#public-instance-methods-should-be-part-of-an-interface)

Public instance methods should always be part of an interface.
This decouples dependencies and simplifies mocking them in unit tests.

```ABAP
METHOD /clean/blog_post~publish.
```

In clean object orientation, having a method public without an interface does not make much sense -
with few exceptions such as enumeration classes
which will never have an alternative implementation and will never be mocked in test cases.

> [Interfaces vs. abstract classes](sub-sections/InterfacesVsAbstractClasses.md)
describes why this also applies to classes that overwrite inherited methods.

### Parameter Number

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [This section](#parameter-number)

#### Aim for few IMPORTING parameters, at best less than three

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Parameter Number](#parameter-number) > [This section](#aim-for-few-importing-parameters-at-best-less-than-three)

```ABAP
FUNCTION seo_class_copy
  IMPORTING
    clskey      TYPE seoclskey
    new_clskey  TYPE seoclskey
    config      TYPE class_copy_config
  EXPORTING
    ...
```

would be much clearer than

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
FUNCTION seo_class_copy
  IMPORTING
    clskey                 TYPE seoclskey
    new_clskey             TYPE seoclskey
    access_permission      TYPE seox_boolean DEFAULT seox_true
    VALUE(save)            TYPE seox_boolean DEFAULT seox_true
    VALUE(suppress_corr)   TYPE seox_boolean DEFAULT seox_false
    VALUE(suppress_dialog) TYPE seox_boolean DEFAULT seox_false
    VALUE(authority_check) TYPE seox_boolean DEFAULT seox_true
    lifecycle_manager      TYPE REF TO if_adt_lifecycle_manager OPTIONAL
    lock_handle            TYPE REF TO if_adt_lock_handle OPTIONAL
    VALUE(suppress_commit) TYPE seox_boolean DEFAULT seox_false
  EXPORTING
    ...
```

Too many input parameters let the complexity of a method explode
because it needs to handle an exponential number of combinations.
Many parameters are an indicator that the method may do more than one thing.

You can reduce the number of parameters by combining them into meaningful sets with structures and objects.

#### Split methods instead of adding OPTIONAL parameters

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Parameter Number](#parameter-number) > [This section](#split-methods-instead-of-adding-optional-parameters)

```ABAP
METHODS do_one_thing IMPORTING what_i_need TYPE string.
METHODS do_another_thing IMPORTING something_else TYPE i.
```

to achieve the desired semantic as ABAP does not support [overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading).

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHODS do_one_or_the_other
  IMPORTING
    what_i_need    TYPE string OPTIONAL
    something_else TYPE i OPTIONAL.
```

Optional parameters confuse callers:

- Which ones are really required?
- Which combinations are valid?
- Which ones exclude each other?

Multiple methods with specific parameters for the use case avoid this confusion by giving clear guidance which parameter combinations are valid and expected.

#### Use PREFERRED PARAMETER sparingly

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Parameter Number](#parameter-number) > [This section](#use-preferred-parameter-sparingly)

The addition `PREFERRED PARAMETER` makes it hard to see which parameter is actually supplied,
making it harder to understand the code.
Minimizing the number of parameters, especially optional ones,
automatically reduces the need for `PREFERRED PARAMETER`.

#### RETURN, EXPORT, or CHANGE exactly one parameter

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Parameter Number](#parameter-number) > [This section](#return-export-or-change-exactly-one-parameter)

A good method does _one thing_, and that should be reflected by the method also returning exactly one thing.
If the output parameters of your method do _not_ form a logical entity,
your method does more than one thing and you should split it.

There are cases where the output is a logical entity that consists of multiple things.
These are easiest represented by returning a structure or object:

```ABAP
TYPES:
  BEGIN OF check_result,
    result      TYPE result_type,
    failed_keys TYPE /bobf/t_frw_key,
    messages    TYPE /bobf/t_frw_message,
  END OF check_result.

METHODS check_business_partners
  IMPORTING
    business_partners TYPE business_partners
  RETURNING
    VALUE(result)     TYPE check_result.
```

instead of

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHODS check_business_partners
  IMPORTING
    business_partners TYPE business_partners
  EXPORTING
    result            TYPE result_type
    failed_keys       TYPE /bobf/t_frw_key
    messages          TYPE /bobf/t_frw_message.
```

Especially in comparison to multiple EXPORTING parameters, this allows people to use the functional call style,
spares you having to think about `IS SUPPLIED` and saves people from accidentally forgetting
to retrieve a vital `ERROR_OCCURRED` information.

Instead of multiple optional output parameters, consider splitting the method according to meaningful call patterns:

```ABAP
TYPES:
  BEGIN OF check_result,
    result      TYPE result_type,
    failed_keys TYPE /bobf/t_frw_key,
    messages    TYPE /bobf/t_frw_message,
  END OF check_result.

METHODS check
  IMPORTING
    business_partners TYPE business_partners
  RETURNING
    VALUE(result)     TYPE result_type.

METHODS check_and_report
  IMPORTING
    business_partners TYPE business_partners
  RETURNING
    VALUE(result)     TYPE check_result.
```

### Parameter Types

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [This section](#parameter-types)

#### Prefer RETURNING to EXPORTING

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Parameter Types](#parameter-types) > [This section](#prefer-returning-to-exporting)

```ABAP
METHODS square
  IMPORTING
    number        TYPE i
  RETURNING
    VALUE(result) TYPE i.

DATA(result) = square( 42 ).
```

Instead of the needlessly longer

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHODS square
  IMPORTING
    number TYPE i
  EXPORTING
    result TYPE i.

square(
  EXPORTING
    number = 42
  IMPORTING
    result = DATA(result) ).
```

`RETURNING` not only makes the call shorter,
it also allows method chaining and prevents [same-input-and-output errors](#take-care-if-input-and-output-could-be-the-same).

#### RETURNING large tables is usually okay

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Parameter Types](#parameter-types) > [This section](#returning-large-tables-is-usually-okay)

Although the ABAP language documentation and performance guides say otherwise,
we rarely encounter cases where handing over a large or deeply-nested table in a VALUE parameter
_really_ causes performance problems.
We therefore recommend to generally use

```ABAP
METHODS get_large_table
  RETURNING
    VALUE(result) TYPE /clean/some_table_type.

METHOD get_large_table.
  result = large_table.
ENDMETHOD.

DATA(my_table) = get_large_table( ).
```

Only if there is actual proof (= a bad performance measurement) for your individual case
should you resort to the more cumbersome procedural style

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHODS get_large_table
  EXPORTING
    result TYPE /dirty/some_table_type.

METHOD get_large_table.
  result = large_table.
ENDMETHOD.

get_large_table( IMPORTING result = DATA(my_table) ).
```

> This section contradicts the ABAP Programming Guidelines and Code Inspector checks,
> both of whom suggest that large tables should be EXPORTED by reference to avoid performance deficits.
> We consistently failed to reproduce any performance and memory deficits
> and received notice about kernel optimization that generally improves RETURNING performance,
> see [_Sharing Between Dynamic Data Objects_ in the ABAP Language Help](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenmemory_consumption_3.htm).

#### Use either RETURNING or EXPORTING or CHANGING, but not a combination

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Parameter Types](#parameter-types) > [This section](#use-either-returning-or-exporting-or-changing-but-not-a-combination)

```ABAP
METHODS copy_class
  IMPORTING
    old_name      TYPE seoclsname
    new name      TYPE secolsname
  RETURNING
    VALUE(result) TYPE copy_result
  RAISING
    /clean/class_copy_failure.
```

instead of confusing mixtures like

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHODS copy_class
  ...
  RETURNING
    VALUE(result)      TYPE vseoclass
  EXPORTING
    error_occurred     TYPE abap_bool
  CHANGING
    correction_request TYPE trkorr
    package            TYPE devclass.
```

Different sorts of output parameters is an indicator that the method does more than one thing.
It confuses the reader and makes calling the method needlessly complicated.

An acceptable exception to this rule may be builders that consume their input while building their output:

```ABAP
METHODS build_tree
  CHANGING
    tokens        TYPE tokens
  RETURNING
    VALUE(result) TYPE REF TO tree.
```

However, even those can be made clearer by objectifying the input:

```ABAP
METHODS build_tree
  IMPORTING
    tokens        TYPE REF TO token_stack
  RETURNING
    VALUE(result) TYPE REF TO tree.
```

#### Use CHANGING sparingly, where suited

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Parameter Types](#parameter-types) > [This section](#use-changing-sparingly-where-suited)

`CHANGING` should be reserved for cases where an existing local variable
that is already filled is updated in only some places:

```ABAP
METHODS update_references
  IMPORTING
    new_reference TYPE /bobf/conf_key
  CHANGING
    bo_nodes      TYPE root_nodes.

METHOD update_references.
  LOOP AT bo_nodes REFERENCE INTO DATA(bo_node).
    bo_node->reference = new_reference.
  ENDLOOP.
ENDMETHOD.
```

Do not force your callers to introduce unnecessary local variables only to supply your `CHANGING` parameter.
Do not use `CHANGING` parameters to initially fill a previously empty variable.

#### Split method instead of Boolean input parameter

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Parameter Types](#parameter-types) > [This section](#split-method-instead-of-boolean-input-parameter)

Boolean input parameters are often an indicator
that a method does _two_ things instead of one.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHODS update
  IMPORTING
    do_save TYPE abap_bool.
```

Also, method calls with a single - and thus unnamed - Boolean parameter
tend to obscure the parameter's meaning.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
update( abap_true ).  " what does 'true' mean? synchronous? simulate? commit?
```

Splitting the method may simplify the methods' code
and describe the different intentions better

```ABAP
update_without_saving( ).
update_and_save( ).
```

Common perception suggests that setters for Boolean variables are okay:

```ABAP
METHODS set_is_deleted
  IMPORTING
    new_value TYPE abap_bool.
```

### Parameter Names

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [This section](#parameter-names)

#### Consider calling the RETURNING parameter RESULT

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Parameter Names](#parameter-names) > [This section](#consider-calling-the-returning-parameter-result)

Good method names are usually so good that the `RETURNING` parameter does not need a name of its own.
The name would do little more than parrot the method name or repeat something obvious.

Repeating a member name can even produce conflicts that need to be resolved by adding a superfluous `me->`.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHODS get_name
  RETURNING
    VALUE(name) TYPE string.

METHOD get_name.
  name = me->name.
ENDMETHOD.
```

In these cases, simply call the parameter `RESULT`, or something like `RV_RESULT` if you prefer Hungarian notation.

Name the `RETURNING` parameter if it is _not_ obvious what it stands for,
for example in methods that return `me` for method chaining,
or in methods that create something but don't return the created entity but only its key or so.

### Parameter Initialization

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [This section](#parameter-initialization)

#### Clear or overwrite EXPORTING reference parameters

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Parameter Initialization](#parameter-initialization) > [This section](#clear-or-overwrite-exporting-reference-parameters)

Reference parameters refer to existing memory areas that may be filled beforehand.
Clear or overwrite them to provide reliable data:

```ABAP
METHODS square
  EXPORTING
    result TYPE i.

" clear
METHOD square.
  CLEAR result.
  " ...
ENDMETHOD.

" overwrite
METHOD square.
  result = cl_abap_math=>square( 2 ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

> Code inspector and Checkman point out `EXPORTING` variables that are never written.
Use these static checks to avoid this otherwise rather obscure error source.

##### Take care if input and output could be the same

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Parameter Initialization](#parameter-initialization) > [Clear or overwrite EXPORTING reference parameters](#clear-or-overwrite-exporting-reference-parameters) > [This section](#take-care-if-input-and-output-could-be-the-same)

Generally, it is a good idea to clear the parameter as a first thing in the method after type and data declarations.
This makes the statement easy to spot and avoids that the still-contained value is accidentally used by later statements.

However, some parameter configurations could use the same variable as input and output.
In this case, an early `CLEAR` would delete the input value before it can be used, producing wrong results.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA value TYPE i.

square_dirty(
  EXPORTING
    number = value
  IMPORTING
    result = value ).

METHOD square_dirty.
  CLEAR result.
  result = number * number.
ENDMETHOD.
```

Consider redesigning such methods by replacing `EXPORTING` with `RETURNING`.
Also consider overwriting the `EXPORTING` parameter in a single result calculation statement.
If neither fits, resort to a late `CLEAR`.

#### Don't clear VALUE parameters

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Parameter Initialization](#parameter-initialization) > [This section](#dont-clear-value-parameters)

Parameters that work by `VALUE` are handed over as new, separate memory areas that are empty by definition.
Don't clear them again:

```ABAP
METHODS square
  EXPORTING
    VALUE(result) TYPE i.

METHOD square.
  " no need to CLEAR result
ENDMETHOD.
```

`RETURNING` parameters are always `VALUE` parameters, so you never have to clear them:

```ABAP
METHODS square
  RETURNING
    VALUE(result) TYPE i.

METHOD square.
  " no need to CLEAR result
ENDMETHOD.
```

### Method Body

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [This section](#method-body)

#### Do one thing, do it well, do it only

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Method Body](#method-body) > [This section](#do-one-thing-do-it-well-do-it-only)

A method should do one thing, and only one thing.
It should do it in the best way possible.

A method likely does one thing if

- it has [few input parameters](#aim-for-few-importing-parameters-at-best-less-than-three)
- it [doesn't include Boolean parameters](#split-method-instead-of-boolean-input-parameter)
- it has [exactly one output parameter](#return-export-or-change-exactly-one-parameter)
- it is [small](#keep-methods-small)
- it [descends one level of abstraction](#descend-one-level-of-abstraction)
- it only [throws one type of exception](#throw-one-type-of-exception)
- you cannot extract meaningful other methods
- you cannot meaningfully group its statements into sections

#### Focus on the happy path or error handling, but not both

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Method Body](#method-body) > [This section](#focus-on-the-happy-path-or-error-handling-but-not-both)

As a specialization of the rule [_Do one thing, do it well, do it only_](#do-one-thing-do-it-well-do-it-only),
a method should either follow the happy-path it's built for,
or the error-handling-detour in case it can't,
but probably not both.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHOD append_xs.
  IF input > 0.
    DATA(remainder) = input.
    WHILE remainder > 0.
      result = result && `X`.
      remainder = remainder - 1.
    ENDWHILE.
  ELSEIF input = 0.
    RAISE EXCEPTION /dirty/sorry_cant_do( ).
  ELSE.
    RAISE EXCEPTION cx_sy_illegal_argument( ).
  ENDIF.
ENDMETHOD.
```

Can be decomposed into

```ABAP
METHOD append_xs.
  validate( input ).
  DATA(remainder) = input.
  WHILE remainder > 0.
    result = result && `X`.
    remainder = remainder - 1.
  ENDWHILE.
ENDMETHOD.

METHOD validate.
  IF input = 0.
    RAISE EXCEPTION /dirty/sorry_cant_do( ).
  ELSEIF input < 0.
    RAISE EXCEPTION cx_sy_illegal_argument( ).
  ENDIF.
ENDMETHOD.
```

or, to stress the validation part

```ABAP
METHOD append_xs.
  IF input > 0.
    result = append_xs_without_check( input ).
  ELSEIF input = 0.
    RAISE EXCEPTION /dirty/sorry_cant_do( ).
  ELSE.
    RAISE EXCEPTION cx_sy_illegal_argument( ).
  ENDIF.
ENDMETHOD.

METHOD append_xs_without_check.
  DATA(remainder) = input.
  WHILE remainder > 0.
    result = result && `X`.
    remainder = remainder - 1.
  ENDWHILE.
ENDMETHOD.
```

#### Descend one level of abstraction

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Method Body](#method-body) > [This section](#descend-one-level-of-abstraction)

Statements in a method should be one level of abstraction below the method itself.
Correspondingly, they should all be on the same level of abstraction.

```ABAP
METHOD create_and_publish.
  post = create_post( user_input ).
  post->publish( ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

instead of confusing mixtures of low level (`trim`, `to_upper`, ...) and high level (`publish`, ...) concepts like

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHOD create_and_publish.
  post = NEW blog_post( ).
  DATA(user_name) = trim( to_upper( sy-uname ) ).
  post->set_author( user_name ).
  post->publish( ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

A reliable way to find out what the right level of abstraction is is this:
Let the method's author explain what the method does in few, short words, without looking at the code.
The bullets (s)he numbers are the sub-methods the method should call or the statements it should execute.

#### Keep methods small

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Method Body](#method-body) > [This section](#keep-methods-small)

Methods should have less than 20 statements, optimal around 3 to 5 statements.

```ABAP
METHOD read_and_parse_version_filters.
  DATA(active_model_version) = read_random_version_under( model_guid ).
  DATA(filter_json) = read_model_version_filters( active_model_version-guid ).
  result = parse_model_version_filters( filter_json ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

The following `DATA` declaration alone is sufficient to see that the surrounding method does way more than one thing:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA:
  class           TYPE vseoclass,
  attributes      TYPE seoo_attributes_r,
  methods         TYPE seoo_methods_r,
  events          TYPE seoo_events_r,
  types           TYPE seoo_types_r,
  aliases         TYPE seoo_aliases_r,
  implementings   TYPE seor_implementings_r,
  inheritance     TYPE vseoextend,
  friendships     TYPE seof_friendships_r,
  typepusages     TYPE seot_typepusages_r,
  clsdeferrds     TYPE seot_clsdeferrds_r,
  intdeferrds     TYPE seot_intdeferrds_r,
  attribute       TYPE vseoattrib,
  method          TYPE vseomethod,
  event           TYPE vseoevent,
  type            TYPE vseotype,
  alias           TYPE seoaliases,
  implementing    TYPE vseoimplem,
  friendship      TYPE seofriends,
  typepusage      TYPE vseotypep,
  clsdeferrd      TYPE vseocdefer,
  intdeferrd      TYPE vseoidefer,
  new_clskey_save TYPE seoclskey.
```

Of course there are occasions where it does not make sense to reduce a larger method further.
This is perfectly okay as long as the method remains [focused on one thing](#do-one-thing-do-it-well-do-it-only):

```ABAP
METHOD decide_what_to_do.
  CASE temperature.
    WHEN burning.
      result = air_conditioning.
    WHEN hot.
      result = ice_cream.
    WHEN moderate.
      result = chill.
    WHEN cold.
      result = skiing.
    WHEN freezing.
      result = hot_cocoa.
  ENDCASE.
ENDMETHOD.
```

However, it still makes sense to validate whether the verbose code hides a more suitable pattern:

```ABAP
METHOD decide_what_to_do.
  result = VALUE #( spare_time_activities[ temperature = temperature ] OPTIONAL ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

### Control flow

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [This section](#control-flow)

#### Fail fast

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Control flow](#control-flow) > [This section](#fail-fast)

Validate and fail as early as possible:

```ABAP
METHOD do_something.
  IF input IS INITIAL.
    RAISE EXCEPTION cx_sy_illegal_argument( ).
  ENDIF.
  DATA(massive_object) = build_expensive_object_from( input ).
  result = massive_object->do_some_fancy_calculation( ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

Later validations are harder to spot and understand and may have already wasted resources to get there.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHOD do_something.
  DATA(massive_object) = build_expensive_object_from( input ).
  IF massive_object IS NOT BOUND. " happens if input is initial
    RAISE EXCEPTION cx_sy_illegal_argument( ).
  ENDIF.
  result = massive_object->do_some_fancy_calculation( ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

#### CHECK vs. RETURN

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Control flow](#control-flow) > [This section](#check-vs-return)

There is no consensus on whether you should use `CHECK` or `RETURN` to exit a method
if the input doesn't meet expectations.

While `CHECK` definitely provides the shorter syntax

```ABAP
METHOD read_customizing.
  CHECK keys IS NOT INITIAL.
  " do whatever needs doing
ENDMETHOD.
```

the statement's name doesn't reveal what happens if the condition fails,
such that people will probably understand the long form better:

```ABAP
METHOD read_customizing.
  IF keys IS INITIAL.
    RETURN.
  ENDIF.
  " do whatever needs doing
ENDMETHOD.
```

You could avoid the question completely by reversing the validation and adopting a single-return control flow.
This is considered to be an anti-pattern because it introduces unnecessary nesting depth.

```ABAP
METHOD read_customizing.
  " anti-pattern
  IF keys IS NOT INITIAL.
    " do whatever needs doing
  ENDIF.
ENDMETHOD.
```

In any case, consider whether returning nothing is really the appropriate behavior.
Methods should provide a meaningful result, meaning either a filled return parameter, or an exception.
Returning nothing is in many cases similar to returning `null`, which should be avoided.

> The [section _Exiting Procedures_ in the ABAP Programming Guidelines](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenexit_procedure_guidl.htm)
> recommends using `CHECK` in this instance.
> Community discussion suggests that the statement is so unclear
> that many people will not understand the program's behavior.

#### Avoid CHECK in other positions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Methods](#methods) > [Control flow](#control-flow) > [This section](#avoid-check-in-other-positions)

Do not use `CHECK` outside of the initialization section of a method.
The statement behaves differently in different positions and may lead to unclear, unexpected effects.

For example,
[`CHECK` in a `LOOP` ends the current iteration and proceeds with the next one](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abapcheck_loop.htm);
people might accidentally expect it to end the method or exit the loop.
Prefer using an `IF` statement in combination with `CONTINUE` instead, since `CONTINUE` only can be used in loops.

> Based on the [section _Exiting Procedures_ in the ABAP Programming Guidelines](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenexit_procedure_guidl.htm).

## Error Handling

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#error-handling)

### Messages

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [This section](#messages)

#### Make messages easy to find

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [Messages](#messages) > [This section](#make-messages-easy-to-find)

To make messages easy to find through a where-used search from transaction SE91, use the following pattern:

```ABAP
MESSAGE e001(ad) INTO DATA(message).
```

In case variable `message` is not needed, add the pragma `##NEEDED`:

```ABAP
MESSAGE e001(ad) INTO DATA(message) ##NEEDED.
```

Avoid the following:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF 1 = 2. MESSAGE e001(ad). ENDIF.
```

This is an anti-pattern since:
- It contains unreachable code.
- It tests a condition which can never be true for equality.

### Return Codes

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [This section](#return-codes)

#### Prefer exceptions to return codes

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [Return Codes](#return-codes) > [This section](#prefer-exceptions-to-return-codes)

```ABAP
METHOD try_this_and_that.
  RAISE EXCEPTION NEW cx_failed( ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

instead of

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHOD try_this_and_that.
  error_occurred = abap_true.
ENDMETHOD.
```

Exceptions have multiple advantages over return codes:

- Exceptions keep your method signatures clean:
you can return the result of the method as a `RETURNING` parameter and still throw exceptions alongside.
Return codes pollute your signatures with additional parameters for error handling.

- The caller doesn't have to react to them immediately.
He can simply write down the happy path of his code.
The exception-handling `CATCH` can be at the very end of his method, or completely outside.

- Exceptions can provide details on the error in their attributes and through methods.
Return codes require you to devise a different solution on your own, such as also returning a log.

- The environment reminds the caller with syntax errors to handle exceptions.
Return codes can be accidentally ignored without anybody noticing.

#### Don't let failures slip through

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [Return Codes](#return-codes) > [This section](#dont-let-failures-slip-through)

If you do have to use return codes, for example because you call Functions and older code not under your control,
make sure you don't let failures slip through.

```ABAP
DATA:
  current_date TYPE string,
  response     TYPE bapiret2.

CALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_GET_CURRENT_DATE'
  IMPORTING
    current_date = current_date
  CHANGING
    response     = response.

IF response-type = 'E'.
  RAISE EXCEPTION NEW /clean/some_error( ).
ENDIF.
```

### Exceptions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [This section](#exceptions)

#### Exceptions are for errors, not for regular cases

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [Exceptions](#exceptions) > [This section](#exceptions-are-for-errors-not-for-regular-cases)

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHODS entry_exists_in_db
  IMPORTING
    key TYPE char10
  RAISING
    cx_not_found_exception.
```

If something is a regular, valid case, it should be handled with regular result parameters.

```ABAP
METHODS entry_exists_in_db
  IMPORTING
    key           TYPE char10
  RETURNING
    VALUE(result) TYPE abap_bool.
```

Exceptions should be reserved for cases that you don't expect and that reflect error situations.

```ABAP
METHODS assert_user_input_is_valid
  IMPORTING
    user_input TYPE string
  RAISING
    cx_bad_user_input.
```

Misusing exceptions misguides the reader into thinking something went wrong, when really everything is just fine.
Exceptions are also much slower than regular code because they need to be constructed
and often gather lots of context information.

#### Use class-based exceptions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [Exceptions](#exceptions) > [This section](#use-class-based-exceptions)

```ABAP
TRY.
    get_component_types( ).
  CATCH cx_has_deep_components_error.
ENDTRY.
```

The outdated non-class-based exceptions have the same features as return codes and shouldn't be used anymore.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
get_component_types(
  EXCEPTIONS
    has_deep_components = 1
    OTHERS              = 2 ).
```

### Throwing

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [This section](#throwing)

#### Use own super classes

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [Throwing](#throwing) > [This section](#use-own-super-classes)

```ABAP
CLASS cx_fra_static_check DEFINITION ABSTRACT INHERITING FROM cx_static_check.
CLASS cx_fra_no_check DEFINITION ABSTRACT INHERITING FROM cx_no_check.
```

Consider creating abstract super classes for each exception type for your application,
instead of sub-classing the foundation classes directly.
Allows you to `CATCH` all _your_ exceptions.
Enables you to add common functionality to all exceptions, such as special text handling.
`ABSTRACT` prevents people from accidentally using these non-descriptive errors directly.

#### Throw one type of exception

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [Throwing](#throwing) > [This section](#throw-one-type-of-exception)

```ABAP
METHODS generate
  RAISING
    cx_generation_error.
```

In the vast majority of cases, throwing multiple types of exceptions has no use.
The caller usually is neither interested nor able to distinguish the error situations.
He will therefore typically handle them all in the same way -
and if this is the case, why distinguish them in the first place?

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHODS generate
  RAISING
    cx_abap_generation
    cx_hdbr_access_error
    cx_model_read_error.
```

A better solution to recognize different error situations is using one exception type
but adding sub-classes that allow - but don't require - reacting to individual error situations,
as described in [Use sub-classes to enable callers to distinguish error situations](#use-sub-classes-to-enable-callers-to-distinguish-error-situations).

#### Use sub-classes to enable callers to distinguish error situations

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [Throwing](#throwing) > [This section](#use-sub-classes-to-enable-callers-to-distinguish-error-situations)

```ABAP
CLASS cx_bad_generation_variable DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cx_generation_error.
CLASS cx_bad_code_composer_template DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cx_generation_error.

METHODS generate RAISING cx_generation_error.

TRY.
    generator->generate( ).
  CATCH cx_bad_generation_variable.
    log_failure( ).
  CATCH cx_bad_code_composer_template INTO DATA(bad_template_exception).
    show_error_to_user( bad_template_exception ).
  CATCH cx_generation_error INTO DATA(other_exception).
    RAISE EXCEPTION NEW cx_application_error( previous =  other_exception ).
ENDTRY.
```

If there are many different error situations, use error codes instead:

```ABAP
CLASS cx_generation_error DEFINITION ...
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    TYPES error_code_type TYPE i.
    CONSTANTS:
      BEGIN OF error_code_enum,
        bad_generation_variable    TYPE error_code_type VALUE 1,
        bad_code_composer_template TYPE error_code_type VALUE 2,
        ...
      END OF error_code_enum.
    DATA error_code TYPE error_code_type.

TRY.
    generator->generate( ).
  CATCH cx_generation_error INTO DATA(exception).
    CASE exception->error_code.
      WHEN cx_generation_error=>error_code_enum-bad_generation_variable.
      WHEN cx_generation_error=>error_code_enum-bad_code_composer_variable.
      ...
    ENDCASE.
ENDTRY.
```

#### Throw CX_STATIC_CHECK for manageable exceptions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [Throwing](#throwing) > [This section](#throw-cx_static_check-for-manageable-exceptions)

If an exception can be expected to occur and be reasonably handled by the receiver,
throw a checked exception inheriting from `CX_STATIC_CHECK`: failing user input validation,
missing resource for which there are fallbacks, etc.

```ABAP
CLASS cx_file_not_found DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cx_static_check.

METHODS read_file
  IMPORTING
    file_name_enterd_by_user TYPE string
  RAISING
    cx_file_not_found.
```

This exception type _must_ be given in method signatures and _must_ be caught or forwarded to avoid syntax errors.
It is therefore plain to see for the consumer and ensures that (s)he won't be surprised by an unexpected exception
and will take care of reacting to the error situation.

> This is in sync with the [ABAP Programming Guidelines](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenexception_category_guidl.htm)
> but contradicts [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_],
> which recommends to prefer unchecked exceptions;
> [Exceptions](sub-sections/Exceptions.md) explains why.

#### Throw CX_NO_CHECK for usually unrecoverable situations

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [Throwing](#throwing) > [This section](#throw-cx_no_check-for-usually-unrecoverable-situations)

If an exception is so severe that the receiver is unlikely to recover from it, use `CX_NO_CHECK`:
failure to read a must-have resource, failure to resolve the requested dependency, etc.

```ABAP
CLASS cx_out_of_memory DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cx_no_check.

METHODS create_guid
  RETURNING
    VALUE(result) TYPE /bobf/conf_key.
```

`CX_NO_CHECK` _cannot_ be declared in method signatures,
such that its occurrence will come as a bad surprise to the consumer.
In the case of unrecoverable situations, this is okay
because the consumer will not be able to do anything useful about it anyway.

However, there _may_ be cases where the consumer actually wants to recognize and react to this kind of failure.
For example, a dependency manager could throw a `CX_NO_CHECK` if it's unable to provide an implementation
for a requested interface because regular application code will not be able to continue.
However, there may be a test report that tries to instantiate all kinds of things just to see if it's working,
and that will report failure simply as a red entry in a list -
this service should be able to catch and ignore the exception instead of being forced to dump.

#### Consider CX_DYNAMIC_CHECK for avoidable exceptions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [Throwing](#throwing) > [This section](#consider-cx_dynamic_check-for-avoidable-exceptions)

Use cases for `CX_DYNAMIC_CHECK` are rare,
and in general we recommend to resort to the other exception types.
However, you may want to consider this kind of exception
as a replacement for `CX_STATIC_CHECK` if the caller has full,
conscious control over whether an exception can occur.

```ABAP
DATA value TYPE decfloat.
value = '7.13'.
cl_abap_math=>get_db_length_decs(
  EXPORTING
    in     = value
  IMPORTING
    length = DATA(length) ).
```

For example, consider the method `get_db_length_decs`
of class `cl_abap_math`, that tells you the number of digits
and decimal places of a decimal floating point number.
This method raises the dynamic exception `cx_parameter_invalid_type`
if the input parameter does not reflect a decimal floating point number.
Usually, this method will be called
for a fully and statically typed variable,
such that the developer knows
whether that exception can ever occur or not.
In this case, the dynamic exception would enable the caller
to omit the unnecessary `CATCH` clause.

#### Dump for totally unrecoverable situations

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [Throwing](#throwing) > [This section](#dump-for-totally-unrecoverable-situations)

If a situation is so severe that you are totally sure the receiver is unlikely to recover from it,
or that clearly indicates a programming error, dump instead of throwing an exception:
failure to acquire memory, failed index reads on a table that must be filled, etc.

```ABAP
RAISE SHORTDUMP TYPE cx_sy_create_object_error.  " >= NW 7.53
MESSAGE x666(general).                           " < NW 7.53
```

This behavior will prevent any kind of consumer from doing anything useful afterwards.
Use this only if you are sure about that.

#### Prefer RAISE EXCEPTION NEW to RAISE EXCEPTION TYPE

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [Throwing](#throwing) > [This section](#prefer-raise-exception-new-to-raise-exception-type)

Note: Available from NW 7.52 onwards.

```ABAP
RAISE EXCEPTION NEW cx_generation_error( previous = exception ).
```

in general is shorter than the needlessly longer

```ABAP
RAISE EXCEPTION TYPE cx_generation_error
  EXPORTING
    previous = exception.
```

However, if you make massive use of the addition `MESSAGE`, you may want to stick with the `TYPE` variant:

```ABAP
RAISE EXCEPTION TYPE cx_generation_error
  MESSAGE e136(messages)
  EXPORTING
    previous = exception.
```

### Catching

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Error Handling](#error-handling) > [This section](#catching)

#### Wrap foreign exceptions instead of letting them invade your code

ENDMETHOD.
```

The [Law of Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter) recommends de-coupling things.
Forwarding exceptions from other components violates this principle.
Make yourself independent from the foreign code by catching those exceptions
and wrapping them in an exception type of your own.

ENDMETHOD.

METHOD is_invalid.
  DATA zero_if_invalid TYPE i.
  zero_if_invalid = date.
  result = xsdbool( zero_if_invalid = 0 ).
ENDMETHOD.

METHOD reduce_day_by_one.
  date+6(2) = date+6(2) - 1.
ENDMETHOD.
```

instead of

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
" correct e.g. 29.02. in non-leap years as well as result of a date calculation would be
" something like e.g. the 31.06. that example has to be corrected to 30.06.
METHOD fix_day_overflow.
  DO 3 TIMES.
    " 31 - 28 = 3 => this correction is required not more than 3 times
    lv_dummy = cv_date.
    " lv_dummy is 0 if the date value is a not existing date - ABAP specific implementation
    IF ( lv_dummy EQ 0 ).
      cv_date+6(2) = cv_date+6(2) - 1. " subtract 1 day from the given date
    ELSE.
      " date exists => no correction required
      EXIT.
    ENDIF.
  ENDDO.
ENDMETHOD.
```

Clean Code does _not_ forbid you to comment your code - it encourages you to exploit _better_ means,
and resort to comments only if that fails.

### Comments are no excuse for bad names

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Comments](#comments) > [This section](#comments-are-no-excuse-for-bad-names)

```ABAP
DATA(input_has_entries) = has_entries( input ).
```

Improve your names instead of explaining what they really mean or why you chose bad ones.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
" checks whether the table input contains entries
DATA(result) = check_table( input ).
```

### Use methods instead of comments to segment your code

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Comments](#comments) > [This section](#use-methods-instead-of-comments-to-segment-your-code)

```ABAP
DATA(statement) = build_statement( ).
DATA(data) = execute_statement( statement ).
```

This not only makes the intent, structure, and dependencies of the code much clearer,
it also avoids carry-over errors when temporary variables aren't properly cleared between the sections.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
" -----------------
" Build statement
" -----------------
DATA statement TYPE string.
statement = |SELECT * FROM d_document_roots|.

" -----------------
" Execute statement
" -----------------
DATA(result_set) = adbc->execute_sql_query( statement ).
result_set->next_package( IMPORTING data = data ).
```

### Write comments to explain the why, not the what

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Comments](#comments) > [This section](#write-comments-to-explain-the-why-not-the-what)

```ABAP
" can't fail, existence of >= 1 row asserted above
DATA(first_line) = table[ 1 ].
```

Nobody needs repeating the code in natural language

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
" select alert root from database by key
SELECT * FROM d_alert_root WHERE key = key.
```

### Design goes into the design documents, not the code

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Comments](#comments) > [This section](#design-goes-into-the-design-documents-not-the-code)

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
" This class serves a double purpose. First, it does one thing. Then, it does another thing.
" It does so by executing a lot of code that is distributed over the local helper classes.
" To understand what's going on, let us at first ponder the nature of the universe as such.
" Have a look at this and that to get the details.
```

Nobody reads that - seriously.
If people need to read a textbook to be able to use your code,
this may be an indicator that your code has severe design issues that you should solve otherwise.
Some code _does_ need some explanation beyond a single line of comment;
consider linking the design document in these cases.

### Comment with ", not with *

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Comments](#comments) > [This section](#comment-with--not-with-)

Quote comments indent along with the statements they comment

```ABAP
METHOD do_it.
  IF input IS NOT INITIAL.
    " delegate pattern
    output = calculate_result( input ).
  ENDIF.
ENDMETHOD.
```

Asterisked comments tend to indent to weird places

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHOD do_it.
  IF input IS NOT INITIAL.
* delegate pattern
    output = calculate_result( input ).
  ENDIF.
ENDMETHOD.
```

### Put comments before the statement they relate to

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Comments](#comments) > [This section](#put-comments-before-the-statement-they-relate-to)

```ABAP
" delegate pattern
output = calculate_result( input ).
```

Clearer than

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
output = calculate_result( input ).
" delegate pattern
```

And less invasive than

```ABAP
output = calculate_result( input ).  " delegate pattern
```

### Delete code instead of commenting it

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Comments](#comments) > [This section](#delete-code-instead-of-commenting-it)

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
* output = calculate_result( input ).
```

When you find something like this, delete it.
The code is obviously not needed because your application works and all tests are green.
Deleted code can be reproduced from the version history later on.
If you need to preserve a piece of code permanently, copy it to a file or a `$TMP` or `HOME` object.

### Don't do manual versioning

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Comments](#comments) > [This section](#dont-do-manual-versioning)

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
* ticket 800034775 ABC ++ Start
output = calculate_result( input ).
* ticket 800034775 ABC ++ End
```
Attribution comments tend to pollute the code and don't provide big benefits as versioning is already done by source code management. Transport order texts are much more suitable for describing why something was adapted.

### Use FIXME, TODO, and XXX and add your ID

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Comments](#comments) > [This section](#use-fixme-todo-and-xxx-and-add-your-id)

```ABAP
METHOD do_something.
  " XXX FH delete this method - it does nothing
ENDMETHOD.
```

- `FIXME` points to errors that are too small or too much in-the-making for internal incidents.
- `TODO`s are places where you want to complete something in the near(!) future.
- `XXX` marks code that works but could be better.

When you enter such a comment, add your nick, initials, or user to enable your co-developers to contact you
and ask questions if the comment is unclear.

### Don't add method signature and end-of comments

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Comments](#comments) > [This section](#dont-add-method-signature-and-end-of-comments)

Method signature comments don't help anybody.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
* <SIGNATURE>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
* | Static Public Method CALIBRATION_KPIS=>CALCULATE_KPI
* +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
* | [--->] STRATEGY_ID                 TYPE        STRATEGY_ID
* | [--->] THRESHOLD                   TYPE        STRATEGY_THRESHOLD
* | [--->] DETECTION_OBJECT_SCORE      TYPE        T_HIT_RESULT
* | [<---] KPI                         TYPE        T_SIMULATED_KPI
* +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</SIGNATURE>
```

Decades ago, when you couldn't see the method signature when inspecting its code,
or working with printouts that had dozens of pages, these comments may have made sense.
But all modern ABAP IDEs (SE24, SE80, ADT) show the method signature easily
such that these comments have become nothing but noise.

> In the form-based editor of SE24/SE80, press button _Signature_.
> In the ABAP Development Tools, mark the method name and press F2
> or add the view _ABAP Element Info_ to your perspective.

Similarly, end-of comments are superfluous.
These comments may have been helpful decades ago,
when programs and functions and the nested IFs inside were hundreds of lines of code long.
But our modern coding style produces methods short enough to readily see
what opening statement an `ENDIF` or `ENDMETHOD` belongs to:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHOD get_kpi_calc.
  IF has_entries = abap_false.
    result = 42.
  ENDIF.  " IF has_entries = abap_false
ENDMETHOD.   " get_kpi_calc
```

### Don't duplicate message texts as comments

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Comments](#comments) > [This section](#dont-duplicate-message-texts-as-comments)

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
" alert category not filled
MESSAGE e003 INTO dummy.
```

Messages change independently from your code,
and nobody will remember adjusting the comment,
such that it will outdate and even become misleading quickly
and without anybody noticing.

The modern IDEs give you easy ways to see the text behind a message,
for example in the ABAP Development Tools,
mark the message ID and press F2.

If you want it more explicit,
consider extracting the message to a method of its own.

```ABAP
METHOD create_alert_not_found_message.
  MESSAGE e003 INTO dummy.
ENDMETHOD.
```

### ABAP Doc only for public APIs

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Comments](#comments) > [This section](#abap-doc-only-for-public-apis)

Write ABAP Doc to document public APIs,
meaning APIs that are intended for developers
in other teams or applications.
Don't write ABAP Doc for internal stuff.

ABAP Doc suffers from the same weaknesses as all comments,
that is, it outdates quickly and then becomes misleading.
As a consequence, you should employ it only where it makes sense,
not enforce writing ABAP Doc for each and everything.

> Read more in _Chapter 4: Good Comments: Javadocs in Public APIs_ and _Chapter 4: Bad Comments:
> Javadocs in Nonpublic Code_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_].

### Prefer pragmas to pseudo comments

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Comments](#comments) > [This section](#prefer-pragmas-to-pseudo-comments)

Prefer pragmas to pseudo comments to suppress irrelevant warnings and errors identified by the ATC. Pseudo comments 
have mostly become obsolete and have been replaced by pragmas.

```ABAP
" pattern
MESSAGE e001(ad) INTO DATA(message) ##NEEDED.

" anti-pattern
MESSAGE e001(ad) INTO DATA(message). "#EC NEEDED
```

Use program `ABAP_SLIN_PRAGMAS` or table `SLIN_DESC` to find the mapping between obsolete pseudo comments and the pragmas that 
have replaced them.

## Formatting

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#formatting)

The suggestions below are [optimized for reading, not for writing](#optimize-for-reading-not-for-writing).
As the ABAP Formatter doesn't cover them, some of them produce additional manual work to reformat statements
when name lengths etc. change; if you want to avoid this, consider dropping rules like
[Align assignments to the same object, but not to different ones](#align-assignments-to-the-same-object-but-not-to-different-ones).

### Be consistent

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#be-consistent)

Format all code of a project in the same way.
Let all team members use the same formatting style.

If you edit foreign code, adhere to that project's formatting style
instead of insisting on your personal style.

If you change your formatting rules over time,
use [refactoring best practices](#how-to-refactor-legacy-code)
to update your code over time.

### Optimize for reading, not for writing

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#optimize-for-reading-not-for-writing)

Developers spend most time _reading_ code.
Actually _writing_ code takes up a way smaller portion of the day.

As a consequence, you should optimize your code formatting for reading and debugging, not for writing.

For example, you should prefer

```ABAP
DATA:
  a TYPE b,
  c TYPE d,
  e TYPE f.
```

to hacks such as

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA:
  a TYPE b
  ,c TYPE d
  ,e TYPE f.
```

### Use the ABAP Formatter before activating

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#use-the-abap-formatter-before-activating)

Apply the ABAP Formatter - Shift+F1 in SE80, SE24, and ADT - before activating an object.  
Note: ABAP Formatter is known as Pretty Printer in SAP GUI.

If you modify a larger unformatted legacy code base,
you may want to apply the ABAP Formatter only to selected lines
to avoid huge change lists and transport dependencies.
Consider formatting the complete development object
in a separate Transport Request or Note.

> Read more in _Chapter 5: Formatting: Team Rules_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_].

### Use your team's ABAP Formatter settings

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#use-your-teams-abap-formatter-settings)

Always use your team's ABAP Formatter settings.
Specify them under
* Eclipse: Right-click on the project in the Project Explorer > _Properties_ > _ABAP Development_ > _Editors_ > _Source Code Editors_ > _ABAP Formatter_
* Eclipse (alternative navigation): _Menu_ > _Window_ > _Preferences_ > _ABAP Development_ > _Editors_ > _Source Code Editors_ > Click on the _ABAP Formatter_ link on the right-hand side > Select project in pop-up
* SAP GUI: _Menu_ > _Utilities_ > _Settings ..._ > _ABAP Editor_ > _Pretty Printer_.

Set _Indent_ and _Convert Uppercase/Lowercase_ > _Uppercase Keyword_
as agreed in your team.

> [Upper vs. Lower Case](sub-sections/UpperVsLowerCase.md) explains
> why we do not give clear guidance for the type case of keywords.
>
> Read more in _Chapter 5: Formatting: Team Rules_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_].

### No more than one statement per line

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#no-more-than-one-statement-per-line)

```ABAP
DATA do_this TYPE i.
do_this = input + 3.
```

Even if some occurrences may trick you into the misconception that this was readable:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA do_this TYPE i. do_this = input + 3.
```

### Stick to a reasonable line length

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#stick-to-a-reasonable-line-length)

Adhere to a maximum line length of 120 characters.

The human eye reads text more comfortably if the lines are not too wide -
ask a UI designer or eye movement researcher of your choice.
You will also appreciate the narrower code when debugging or comparing two sources next to each other.

The 80 or even 72 characters limit originating in the old terminal devices is a little too restrictive.
While 100 characters are often recommended and a viable choice, 120 characters seem to work a little better for ABAP,
maybe because of the general verbosity of the language.

> As a reminder you can configure in ADT the print margin to 120 characters,
> which then is visualized in the code view as a vertical line.
> Configure it under _Menu_ > _Window_ > _Preferences_ > _General_ > _Editors_ > _Text Editors_.

### Condense your code

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#condense-your-code)

```ABAP
DATA(result) = calculate( items ).
```

instead of adding unneeded blanks

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA(result)        =      calculate(    items =   items )   .
```

### Add a single blank line to separate things, but not more

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#add-a-single-blank-line-to-separate-things-but-not-more)

```ABAP
DATA(result) = do_something( ).

DATA(else) = calculate_this( result ).
```

to highlight that the two statements do different things. But there is no reason for

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA(result) = do_something( ).



DATA(else) = calculate_this( result ).
```

The urge to add separating blank lines may be an indicator that your method doesn't [do one thing](#do-one-thing-do-it-well-do-it-only).

### Don't obsess with separating blank lines

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#dont-obsess-with-separating-blank-lines)

```ABAP
METHOD do_something.
  do_this( ).
  then_that( ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

No reason for the bad habit to tear your code apart with blank lines

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHOD do_something.

  do_this( ).

  then_that( ).

ENDMETHOD.
```

This is also the case within a statement, as this can easily be misunderstood as a new statement when skimming through the code.
```abap
" anti-pattern
DATA(result) = merge_structures( a = VALUE #( field_1 = 'X'
                                              field_2 = 'A' )

                                 b = NEW /clean/structure_type( field_3 = 'C'
                                                                field_4 = 'D' ) ).
```

Blank lines actually only make sense if you have statements that span multiple lines

```ABAP
METHOD do_something.

  do_this( ).

  then_that(
    EXPORTING
      variable = 'A'
    IMPORTING
      result   = result ).

ENDMETHOD.
```

### Align assignments to the same object, but not to different ones

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#align-assignments-to-the-same-object-but-not-to-different-ones)

To highlight that these things somehow belong together

```ABAP
structure-type = 'A'.
structure-id   = '4711'.
```

or even better

```ABAP
structure = VALUE #( type = 'A'
                     id   = '4711' ).
```

But leave things ragged that have nothing to do with each other:

```ABAP
customizing_reader = fra_cust_obj_model_reader=>s_get_instance( ).
hdb_access = fra_hdbr_access=>s_get_instance( ).
```

> Read more in _Chapter 5: Formatting: Horizontal Alignment_ of [Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_].

### Close brackets at line end

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#close-brackets-at-line-end)

```ABAP
modify->update( node           = if_fra_alert_c=>node-item
                key            = item->key
                data           = item
                changed_fields = changed_fields ).
```

instead of the needlessly longer

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
modify->update( node           = if_fra_alert_c=>node-item
                key            = item->key
                data           = item
                changed_fields = changed_fields
).
```

### Keep single parameter calls on one line

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#keep-single-parameter-calls-on-one-line)

```ABAP
DATA(unique_list) = remove_duplicates( list ).
remove_duplicates( CHANGING list = list ).
```

instead of the needlessly longer

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA(unique_list) = remove_duplicates(
                           list ).
DATA(unique_list) = remove_duplicates(
                         CHANGING
                           list = list ).
```

### Keep parameters behind the call

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#keep-parameters-behind-the-call)

```ABAP
DATA(sum) = add_two_numbers( value_1 = 5
                             value_2 = 6 ).
```

When this makes the lines very long, you can break the parameters into the next line:

```ABAP
DATA(sum) = add_two_numbers(
                value_1 = round_up( input DIV 7 ) * 42 + round_down( 19 * step_size )
                value_2 = VALUE #( ( `Calculation failed with a very weird result` ) ) ).
```

### If you break, indent parameters under the call

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#if-you-break-indent-parameters-under-the-call)

```ABAP
DATA(sum) = add_two_numbers(
                value_1 = 5
                value_2 = 6 ).
```

Aligning the parameters elsewhere makes it hard to spot what they belong to:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA(sum) = add_two_numbers(
    value_1 = 5
    value_2 = 6 ).
```

However, this is the best pattern if you want to avoid the formatting to be broken by a name length change.

### Line-break multiple parameters

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#line-break-multiple-parameters)

```ABAP
DATA(sum) = add_two_numbers( value_1 = 5
                             value_2 = 6 ).
```

Yes, this wastes space.
However, otherwise, it's hard to spot where one parameter ends and the next starts:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA(sum) = add_two_numbers( value_1 = 5 value_2 = 6 ).
```

### Align parameters

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#align-parameters)

```ABAP
modify->update( node           = if_fra_alert_c=>node-item
                key            = item->key
                data           = item
                changed_fields = changed_fields ).
```

Ragged margins make it hard to see where the parameter ends and its value begins:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
modify->update( node = if_fra_alert_c=>node-item
                key = item->key
                data = item
                changed_fields = changed_fields ).
```

> This is on the other side the best pattern if you want to avoid the formatting to be broken by a name length change.

### Break the call to a new line if the line gets too long

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#break-the-call-to-a-new-line-if-the-line-gets-too-long)

```ABAP
DATA(some_super_long_param_name) =
  if_some_annoying_interface~add_two_numbers_in_a_long_name(
      value_1 = 5
      value_2 = 6 ).
```

### Indent and snap to tab

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#indent-and-snap-to-tab)

Indent parameter keywords by 2 spaces and parameters by 4 spaces:

```ABAP
DATA(sum) = add_two_numbers(
              EXPORTING
                value_1 = 5
                value_2 = 6
              CHANGING
                errors  = errors ).
```

If you have no keywords, indent the parameters by 4 spaces.

```ABAP
DATA(sum) = add_two_numbers(
                value_1 = 5
                value_2 = 6 ).
```

Use the Tab key to indent. It's okay if this adds one more space than needed.
(This happens if the `DATA(sum) =` part at the left has an uneven number of characters.)

### Indent in-line declarations like method calls

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#indent-in-line-declarations-like-method-calls)

Indent in-line declarations with VALUE or NEW as if they were method calls:

```ABAP
DATA(result) = merge_structures( a = VALUE #( field_1 = 'X'
                                              field_2 = 'A' )
                                 b = NEW /clean/structure_type( field_3 = 'C'
                                                                field_4 = 'D' ) ).
```

### Don't align type clauses

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#dont-align-type-clauses)

```ABAP
DATA name TYPE seoclsname.
DATA reader TYPE REF TO /clean/reader.
```

A variable and its type belong together and should therefore be visually grouped in close proximity.
Aligning the `TYPE` clauses draws attention away from that and suggests that the variables form one vertical group, and their types another one.
Alignment also produces needless editing overhead, requiring you to adjust all indentations when the length of the longest variable name changes.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA name   TYPE seoclsname.
DATA reader TYPE REF TO /clean/reader.
```

### Don't chain assignments

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Formatting](#formatting) > [This section](#dont-chain-assignments)

```abap
" anti-pattern
var1 = var2 = var3.
```

Chained assignments usually confuse the reader. Besides, the inline declaration doesn't work in any position of a multiple assignment.

```abap
var2 = var3.
var1 = var3.
```

Furthermore, the anti-pattern looks ambiguous because `=` is used for comparisons and assignments in ABAP. It looks similar to how other programming languages implement comparisons, for example `a = ( b == c )` in JavaScript. [Use `xsdbool` for comparisons.](#use-xsdbool-to-set-boolean-variables)

## Testing

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#testing)

### Principles

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [This section](#principles)

#### Write testable code

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Principles](#principles) > [This section](#write-testable-code)

Write all code in a way that allows you to test it in an automatic fashion.

If this requires refactoring your code, do it.
Do that first, before you start adding other features.

If you add to legacy code that is too badly structured to be tested,
refactor it at least to the extent that you can test your additions.

#### Enable others to mock you

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Principles](#principles) > [This section](#enable-others-to-mock-you)

If you write code to be consumed by others, enable them to write unit tests for their own code,
for example by adding interfaces in all outward-facing places,
providing helpful test doubles that facilitate integration tests,
or applying dependency inversion to enable them to substitute the configuration with a test config.

#### Readability rules

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Principles](#principles) > [This section](#readability-rules)

Make your test code even more readable than your production code.
You can tackle bad production code with good tests, but if you don't even get the tests, you're lost.

Keep your test code so simple and stupid that you will still understand it in a year from now.

Stick to standards and patterns, to enable your co-workers to quickly get into the code.

#### Don't make copies or write test reports

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Principles](#principles) > [This section](#dont-make-copies-or-write-test-reports)

Don't start working on a backlog item by making a `$TMP` copy of a development object and playing around with it.
Others won't notice these objects and therefore won't know the status of your work.
You will probably waste a lot of time by making the working copy in the first place.
You will also forget to delete the copy afterwards, spamming your system and dependencies.
(Don't believe this? Go to your development system and check your `$TMP` right now.)

Also, don't start by writing a test report that calls something in a specific way,
and repeat that to verify that things are still working when you're working on it.
This is poor man's testing: repeating a test report by hand and verifying by eye whether everything is still fine.
Take the next step and automate this report in a unit test,
with an automatic assertion that tells you whether the code is still okay.
First, you will spare yourself the effort of having to write the unit tests afterwards.
Second, you will save a lot of time for the manual repetitions, plus avoid getting bored and tired over it.

#### Test publics, not private internals

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Principles](#principles) > [This section](#test-publics-not-private-internals)

Public parts of classes, especially the interfaces they implement, are rather stable and unlikely to change.
Let your unit tests validate only the publics to make them robust
and minimize the effort you have to spend when you refactor the class.
Protected and private internals, in contrast, may change very quickly through refactoring,
such that each refactoring would needlessly break your tests.

An urgent need to test private or protected methods may be an early warning sign for several kinds of design flaws.
Ask yourself:

- Did you accidentally bury a concept in your class that wants to come out into its own class,
with its own dedicated suite of tests?

- Did you forget to separate the domain logic from the glue code?
For example, implementing the domain logic directly in the class that is plugged into BOPF as an action,
determination, or validation, or that was generated by SAP Gateway as a `*_DPC_EXT` data provider, may not the best idea.

- Are your interfaces too complicated and request too much data that is irrelevant or that cannot be mocked easily?

#### Don't obsess about coverage

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Principles](#principles) > [This section](#dont-obsess-about-coverage)

Code coverage is there to help you find code you forgot to test, not to meet some random KPI:

Don't make up tests without or with dummy asserts just to reach the coverage.
Better leave things untested to make transparent that you cannot safely refactor them.
You can have < 100% coverage and still have perfect tests.
There are cases - such as IFs in the constructor to insert test doubles -
that may make it unpractical to reach 100%.
Good tests tend to cover the same statement multiple times, for different branches and conditions.
They will in fact have imaginary > 100% coverage.

### Test Classes

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [This section](#test-classes)

#### Call local test classes by their purpose

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Test Classes](#test-classes) > [This section](#call-local-test-classes-by-their-purpose)

Name local test classes either by the "when" part of the story

```ABAP
CLASS ltc_<public method name> DEFINITION FOR TESTING ... ."
```

or the "given" part of the story

```ABAP
CLASS ltc_<common setup semantics> DEFINITION FOR TESTING ... .
```

```ABAP
" anti-patterns
CLASS ltc_fra_online_detection_api DEFINITION FOR TESTING ... . " We know that's the class under test - why repeat it?
CLASS ltc_test DEFINITION FOR TESTING ....                      " Of course it's a test, what else should it be?
```

#### Put tests in local classes

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Test Classes](#test-classes) > [This section](#put-tests-in-local-classes)

Put unit tests into the local test include of the class under test.
This ensures that people find these tests when refactoring the class
and allows them to run all associated tests with a single key press,
as described in [How to execute test classes](#how-to-execute-test-classes).

Put component-, integration- and system tests into the local test include of a separate global class.
They do not directly relate to a single class under test, therefore they should not arbitrarily be
placed in one of the involved classes, but in a separate one.  
Mark this global test class as `FOR TESTING` and `ABSTRACT`
to avoid that it is accidentally referenced in production code.  
Putting tests into other classes has the danger that people overlook them
and forget to run them when refactoring the involved classes.

Therefore it is beneficial to use *test relations* to document which objects
are tested by the test.  
With the example below the test class `hiring_test`
could be executed while being in the class `recruting` or `candidate` via the shrotcut `Shift-Crtl-F12` (Windows) or `Cmd-Shift-F12` (macOS).

```abap
"! @testing recruting
"! @testing candidate
class hiring_test definition
  for testing risk level dangerous duration medium
  abstract.
  ...
endclass.
```

#### Put help methods in help classes

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Test Classes](#test-classes) > [This section](#put-help-methods-in-help-classes)

Put help methods used by several test classes in a help class. Make the help methods available through 
inheritance (is-a relationship) or delegation (has-a relationship).

```abap
" inheritance example

CLASS lth_unit_tests DEFINITION ABSTRACT.

  PROTECTED SECTION.
    CLASS-METHODS assert_activity_entity
      IMPORTING
        actual_activity_entity TYPE REF TO zcl_activity_entity

```

#### How to execute test classes

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Test Classes](#test-classes) > [This section](#how-to-execute-test-classes)

In the ABAP Development Tools use the following keyboard shortcuts to quickly execute tests:
| Key presses | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`F9` | preview all tests (including test relations) |
| `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`F10` | run all tests in a class |
| `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`F11` | ... and include coverage measurements |
| `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`F12` | ... and also run tests in other classes that are maintained as test relations |

> On macOS, use `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl`.

### Code Under Test

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [This section](#code-under-test)

#### Name the code under test meaningfully, or default to CUT

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Code Under Test](#code-under-test) > [This section](#name-the-code-under-test-meaningfully-or-default-to-cut)

Give the variable that represents the code under test a meaningful name:

```ABAP
DATA blog_post TYPE REF TO ...
```

Don't just repeat the class name with all its non-valuable namespaces and prefixes:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA clean_fra_blog_post TYPE REF TO ...
```

If you have different test setups, it can be helpful to describe the object's varying state:

```ABAP
DATA empty_blog_post TYPE REF TO ...
DATA simple_blog_post TYPE REF TO ...
DATA very_long_blog_post TYPE REF TO ...
```

If you have problems finding a meaningful name, resort to `cut` as a default.
The abbreviation stands for "code under test".

```ABAP
DATA cut TYPE REF TO ...
```

Especially in unclean and confusing tests, calling the variable `cut`
can temporarily help the reader see what's actually tested.
However, tidying up the tests is the actual way to go for the long run.

#### Test against interfaces, not implementations

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Code Under Test](#code-under-test) > [This section](#test-against-interfaces-not-implementations)

A practical consequence of the [_Test publics, not private internals_](#test-publics-not-private-internals),
type your code under test with an _interface_

```ABAP
DATA code_under_test TYPE REF TO some_interface.
```

rather than a _class_

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA code_under_test TYPE REF TO some_class.
```

#### Extract the call to the code under test to its own method

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Code Under Test](#code-under-test) > [This section](#extract-the-call-to-the-code-under-test-to-its-own-method)

If the method to be tested requires a lot of parameters or prepared data,
it can help to extract the call to it to a helper method of its own that defaults the uninteresting parameters:

```ABAP
METHODS map_xml_to_itab
  IMPORTING
    xml_string TYPE string
    config     TYPE /clean/xml2itab_config DEFAULT default_config
    format     TYPE /clean/xml2itab_format DEFAULT default_format.

METHOD map_xml_to_itab.
  result = cut->map_xml_to_itab( xml_string = xml_string
                                 config     = config
                                 format     = format ).
ENDMETHOD.

DATA(itab) = map_xml_to_itab( '<xml></xml>' ).
```

Calling the original method directly can swamp your test with a lot of meaningless details:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA(itab) = cut->map_xml_to_itab( xml_string = '<xml></xml>'
                                   config     = VALUE #( 'some meaningless stuff' )
                                   format     = VALUE #( 'more meaningless stuff' ) ).
```

### Injection

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [This section](#injection)

#### Use dependency inversion to inject test doubles

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Injection](#injection) > [This section](#use-dependency-inversion-to-inject-test-doubles)

Dependency inversion means that you hand over all dependencies to the constructor:

```ABAP
METHODS constructor
  IMPORTING
    customizing_reader TYPE REF TO if_fra_cust_obj_model_reader.

METHOD constructor.
  me->customizing_reader = customizing_reader.
ENDMETHOD.
```

Don't use setter injection.
It enables using the production code in ways that are not intended:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHODS set_customizing_reader
  IMPORTING
    customizing_reader TYPE REF TO if_fra_cust_obj_model_reader.

METHOD do_something.
  object->set_customizing_reader( a ).
  object->set_customizing_reader( b ). " would you expect that somebody does this?
ENDMETHOD.
```

Don't use FRIENDS injection.
It will initialize dependencies before they are replaced, with probably unexpected consequences.
It will break as soon as you rename the internals.
It also circumvents initializations in the constructor.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHOD setup.
  cut = NEW fra_my_class( ). " <- builds the customizing_reader for the production use case first - what will it break with that?
  cut->customizing_reader ?= cl_abap_testdouble=>create( 'if_fra_cust_obj_model_reader' ).
ENDMETHOD.

METHOD constructor.
  customizing_reader = fra_cust_obj_model_reader=>s_get_instance( ).
  customizing_reader->fill_buffer( ). " <- won't be called on your test double, so no chance to test this
ENDMETHOD.
```

#### Consider to use the tool ABAP test double

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Injection](#injection) > [This section](#consider-to-use-the-tool-abap-test-double)

```ABAP
DATA(customizing_reader) = CAST /clean/customizing_reader( cl_abap_testdouble=>create( '/clean/default_custom_reader' ) ).
cl_abap_testdouble=>configure_call( customizing_reader )->returning( sub_claim_customizing ).
customizing_reader->read( 'SOME_ID' ).
```

Shorter and easier to understand than custom test doubles:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
CLASS /dirty/default_custom_reader DEFINITION FOR TESTING CREATE PUBLIC.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    INTERFACES /dirty/customizing_reader.
    DATA customizing TYPE /dirty/customizing_table.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS /dirty/default_custom_reader IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD /dirty/customizing_reader~read.
    result = customizing.
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

METHOD test_something.
  DATA(customizing_reader) = NEW /dirty/customizing_reader( ).
  customizing_reader->customizing = sub_claim_customizing.
ENDMETHOD.
```

#### Exploit the test tools

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Injection](#injection) > [This section](#exploit-the-test-tools)

In general, a clean programming style will let you do much of the work with standard ABAP unit tests and test doubles. A list of the available frameworks with examples can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-test-isolation-examples). The repository might not be completely compliant with the CleanABAP-style guide, it only provides examples to help with test isolation tools.

#### Use test seams as temporary workaround

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Injection](#injection) > [This section](#use-test-seams-as-temporary-workaround)

If all other techniques fail, or when in dangerous shallow waters of legacy code,
refrain to [test seams](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abaptest-seam.htm)
to make things testable.

Although they look comfortable at first sight, test seams are invasive and tend to get entangled
in private dependencies, such that they are hard to keep alive and stable in the long run.

We therefore recommend to refrain to test seams only as a temporary workaround
to allow you refactoring the code into a more testable form.

#### Use LOCAL FRIENDS to access the dependency-inverting constructor

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Injection](#injection) > [This section](#use-local-friends-to-access-the-dependency-inverting-constructor)

```ABAP
CLASS /clean/unit_tests DEFINITION.
  PRIVATE SECTION.
    DATA cut TYPE REF TO /clean/interface_under_test.
    METHODS setup.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS /clean/class_under_test DEFINITION LOCAL FRIENDS unit_tests.

CLASS unit_tests IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD setup.
    DATA(mock) = cl_abap_testdouble=>create( '/clean/some_mock' ).
    " /clean/class_under_test is CREATE PRIVATE
     " so this only works because of the LOCAL FRIENDS
    cut = NEW /clean/class_under_test( mock ).
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
```

#### Don't misuse LOCAL FRIENDS to invade the tested code

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Injection](#injection) > [This section](#dont-misuse-local-friends-to-invade-the-tested-code)

Unit tests that access private and protected members to insert mock data are fragile:
they break when the internal structure of the tested code changes.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
CLASS /dirty/class_under_test DEFINITION LOCAL FRIENDS unit_tests.
CLASS unit_tests IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD returns_right_result.
    cut->some_private_member = 'AUNIT_DUMMY'.
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
```

#### Don't add features to production code that are only intended for use during automated testing

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Injection](#injection) > [This section](#dont-add-features-to-production-code-that-are-only-intended-for-use-during-automated-testing)

For reasons already described under [Test Seams](#use-test-seams-as-temporary-workaround), adding anything to production code that is solely intended for use during automated tests should be avoided.
```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF is_unit_test_running = abap_true.
  "some logic here that runs only during unit tests
ENDIF.  
```
Note that test features intended to be executed by an end user, e.g. simulated posting or running a report in test mode, form part of the application domain and remain a valid use case.

#### Don't sub-class to mock methods

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Injection](#injection) > [This section](#dont-sub-class-to-mock-methods)

Don't sub-class and overwrite methods to mock them in your unit tests.
Although this works, it is fragile because the tests break easily when refactoring the code.
It also enables real consumers to inherit your class,
which [may hit you unprepared when not explicitly designing for it](#final-if-not-designed-for-inheritance).

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
CLASS unit_tests DEFINITION INHERITING FROM /dirty/real_class FOR TESTING [...].
  PROTECTED SECTION.
    METHODS needs_to_be_mocked REDEFINITION.
```

To get legacy code under test,
[resort to test seams instead](#use-test-seams-as-temporary-workaround).
They are just as fragile but still the cleaner way because they at least don't change the class's behavior in production,
as would happen when enabling inheritance by removing a previous `FINAL` flag or by changing method scope from `PRIVATE` to `PROTECTED`.

When writing new code, take this testability issue into account directly when designing the class,
and find a different, better way.
Common best practices include [resorting to other test tools](#exploit-the-test-tools)
and extracting the problem method to a separate class with its own interface.

> A more specific variant of
> [Don't change the production code to make the code testable](#dont-add-features-to-production-code-that-are-only-intended-for-use-during-automated-testing).

#### Don't mock stuff that's not needed

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Injection](#injection) > [This section](#dont-mock-stuff-thats-not-needed)

```ABAP
cut = NEW /clean/class_under_test( db_reader = db_reader
                                   config    = VALUE #( )
                                   writer    = VALUE #( ) ).
```

Define your givens as precisely as possible: don't set data that your test doesn't need,
and don't mock objects that are never called.
These things distract the reader from what's really going on.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
cut = NEW /dirty/class_under_test( db_reader = db_reader
                                   config    = config
                                   writer    = writer ).
```

There are also cases where it's not necessary to mock something at all -
this is usually the case with data structures and data containers.
For example, your unit tests may well work with the production version of a `transient_log`
because it only stores data without any side effects.

#### Don't build test frameworks

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Injection](#injection) > [This section](#dont-build-test-frameworks)

Unit tests - in contrast to integration tests - should be data-in-data-out, with all test data being defined on the fly as needed.

```ABAP
cl_abap_testdouble=>configure_call( test_double )->returning( data ).
```

Don't start building frameworks that distinguish "*test case IDs*" to decide what data to provide.
The resulting code will be so long and tangled that you won't be able to keep these tests alive in the long term.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern

test_double->set_test_case( 1 ).

CASE test_case.
  WHEN 1.
  WHEN 2.
ENDCASE.
```

### Test Methods

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [This section](#test-methods)

#### Test method names: reflect what's given and expected

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Test Methods](#test-methods) > [This section](#test-method-names-reflect-whats-given-and-expected)

Good names reflect the given and then of the test:

```ABAP
METHOD reads_existing_entry.
METHOD throws_on_invalid_key.
METHOD detects_invalid_input.
```

Bad names reflect the when, repeat meaningless facts, or are cryptic:

```ABAP
" anti-patterns

" What's expected, success or failure?
METHOD get_conversion_exits.

" It's a test method, what else should it do but "test"?
METHOD test_loop.

" So it's parameterized, but what is its aim?
METHOD parameterized_test.

" What's "_wo_w" supposed to mean and will you still remember that in a year from now?
METHOD get_attributes_wo_w.
```

As ABAP allows only 30 characters in method names, it's fair to add an explanatory comment
if the name is too short to convey enough meaning.
ABAP Doc or the first line in the test method may be an appropriate choice for the comment.

Having lots of test methods whose names are too long may be an indicator
that you should split your single test class into several ones
and express the differences in the givens in the class's names.

#### Use given-when-then

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Test Methods](#test-methods) > [This section](#use-given-when-then)

Organize your test code along the given-when-then paradigm:
First, initialize stuff in a given section ("given"),
second call the actual tested thing ("when"),
third validate the outcome ("then").

If the given or then sections get so long
that you cannot visually separate the three sections anymore, extract sub-methods.
Blank lines or comments as separators may look good at first glance
but don't really reduce the visual clutter.
Still they are helpful for the reader and the novice test writer to separate the sections.

#### "When" is exactly one call

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Test Methods](#test-methods) > [This section](#when-is-exactly-one-call)

Make sure that the "when" section of your test method contains exactly one call to the class under test:

```ABAP
METHOD rejects_invalid_input.
  " when
  DATA(is_valid) = cut->is_valid_input( 'SOME_RANDOM_ENTRY' ).
  " then
  cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_false( is_valid ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

Calling multiple things indicates that the method has no clear focus and tests too much.
This makes it harder to find the cause when the test fails:
was it the first, second, or third call that caused the failure?
It also confuses the reader because he is not sure what the exact feature under test is.

#### Don't add a TEARDOWN unless you really need it

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Test Methods](#test-methods) > [This section](#dont-add-a-teardown-unless-you-really-need-it)

`teardown` methods are usually only needed to clear up database entries
or other external resources in integration tests.

Resetting members of the test class, esp. `cut` and the used test doubles, is superfluous;
they are overwritten by the `setup` method before the next test method is started.

### Test Data

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [This section](#test-data)

#### Make it easy to spot meaning

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Test Data](#test-data) > [This section](#make-it-easy-to-spot-meaning)

In unit tests, you want to be able to quickly tell which data and doubles are important,
and which ones are only there to keep the code from crashing.
Support this by giving things that have no meaning obvious names and values, for example:

```ABAP
DATA(alert_id) = '42'.                             " well-known meaningless numbers
DATA(detection_object_type) = '?=/"&'.             " 'keyboard accidents'
CONSTANTS some_random_number TYPE i VALUE 782346.  " revealing variable names
```

Don't trick people into believing something connects to real objects or real customizing if it doesn't:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA(alert_id) = '00000001223678871'.        " this alert really exists
DATA(detection_object_type) = 'FRA_SCLAIM'.  " this detection object type, too
CONSTANTS memory_limit TYPE i VALUE 4096.    " this number looks carefully chosen
```

#### Make it easy to spot differences

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Test Data](#test-data) > [This section](#make-it-easy-to-spot-differences)

#### Use constants to describe purpose and importance of test data

```ABAP
CONSTANTS some_nonsense_key TYPE char8 VALUE 'ABCDEFGH'.

METHOD throws_on_invalid_entry.
  TRY.
      " when
      cut->read_entry( some_nonsense_key ).
      cl_abap_unit_assert=>fail( ).
    CATCH /clean/customizing_reader_error.
      " then
  ENDTRY.
ENDMETHOD.
```

### Assertions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [This section](#assertions)

#### Few, focused assertions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Assertions](#assertions) > [This section](#few-focused-assertions)

Assert only exactly what the test method is about, and this with a small number of assertions.

```ABAP
METHOD rejects_invalid_input.
  " when
  DATA(is_valid) = cut->is_valid_input( 'SOME_RANDOM_ENTRY' ).
  " then
  cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_false( is_valid ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

Asserting too much is an indicator that the method has no clear focus.
This couples production and test code in too many places: changing a feature
will require rewriting a large number of tests although they are not really involved with the changed feature.
It also confuses the reader with a large variety of assertions,
obscuring the one important, distinguishing assertion among them.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHOD rejects_invalid_input.
  " when
  DATA(is_valid) = cut->is_valid_input( 'SOME_RANDOM_ENTRY' ).
  " then
  cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_false( is_valid ).
  cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_not_initial( log->get_messages( ) ).
  cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_equals( act = sy-langu
                                      exp = 'E' ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

#### Use the right assert type

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Assertions](#assertions) > [This section](#use-the-right-assert-type)

```ABAP
cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_equals( act = table
                                    exp = test_data ).
```

Asserts often do more than meets the eye, for example `assert_equals`
includes type matching and providing precise descriptions if values differ.
Using the wrong, too-common asserts will force you into the debugger immediately
instead of allowing you to see what is wrong right from the error message.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_true( xsdbool( act = exp ) ).
```

#### Assert content, not quantity

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Assertions](#assertions) > [This section](#assert-content-not-quantity)

```ABAP
assert_contains_exactly( actual   = table
                         expected = VALUE string_table( ( `ABC` ) ( `DEF` ) ( `GHI` ) ) ).
```

Don't write magic-number-quantity assertions if you can express the actual content you expect.
Numbers may vary although the expectations are still met.
In reverse, the numbers may match although the content is something completely unexpected.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
assert_equals( act = lines( log_messages )
               exp = 3 ).
```

#### Assert quality, not content

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Assertions](#assertions) > [This section](#assert-quality-not-content)

If you are interested in a meta quality of the result,
but not in the actual content itself, express that with a suitable assert:

```ABAP
assert_all_lines_shorter_than( actual_lines        = table
                               expected_max_length = 80 ).
```

Asserting the precise content obscures what you actually want to test.
It is also fragile because refactoring may produce a different
but perfectly acceptable result although it breaks all your too-precise unit tests.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
assert_equals( act = table
               exp = VALUE string_table( ( `ABC` ) ( `DEF` ) ( `GHI` ) ) ).
```

#### Use FAIL to check for expected exceptions

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Assertions](#assertions) > [This section](#use-fail-to-check-for-expected-exceptions)

```ABAP
METHOD throws_on_empty_input.
  TRY.
      " when
      cut->do_something( '' ).
      cl_abap_unit_assert=>fail( ).
    CATCH /clean/some_exception.
      " then
  ENDTRY.
ENDMETHOD.
```

#### Forward unexpected exceptions instead of catching and failing

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Assertions](#assertions) > [This section](#forward-unexpected-exceptions-instead-of-catching-and-failing)

```ABAP
METHODS reads_entry FOR TESTING RAISING /clean/some_exception.

METHOD reads_entry.
  "when
  DATA(entry) = cut->read_something( ).
  "then
  cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_not_initial( entry ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

Your test code remains focused on the happy path and is therefore much easier to read and understand, as compared to:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHOD reads_entry.
  TRY.
      DATA(entry) = cut->read_something( ).
    CATCH /clean/some_exception INTO DATA(unexpected_exception).
      cl_abap_unit_assert=>fail( unexpected_exception->get_text( ) ).
  ENDTRY.
  cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_not_initial( entry ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

#### Write custom asserts to shorten code and avoid duplication

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [Testing](#testing) > [Assertions](#assertions) > [This section](#write-custom-asserts-to-shorten-code-and-avoid-duplication)

```ABAP
METHODS assert_contains
  IMPORTING
    actual_entries TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF entries_tab
    expected_key   TYPE key_structure.

METHOD assert_contains.
  TRY.
      actual_entries[ key = expected_key ].
    CATCH cx_sy_itab_line_not_found.
      cl_abap_unit_assert=>fail( |Couldn't find the key { expected_key }| ).
  ENDTRY.
ENDMETHOD.
```

Instead of copy-pasting this over and over again.

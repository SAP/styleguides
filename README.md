This repository provides SAP's style guides for coding.

Programming languages enable us to say the same thing in different ways.
While all of them may be correct, some may be more efficient,
easier to understand, and more robust and than others.

Our style guides want to show up differences and guide you
towards code that has a healthy balance between all of these.

## Style Guides

- [**Clean ABAP**](guide/CleanABAP.md)

## Public

This material is **public**, as described in
SAP's _Global Information Classification & Handling Standard_
[(internal link)](https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1891700683),
meaning you can freely share it with anybody.

We believe that everybody should be enabled to code cleanly.

## Optional

Following this guide is **optional**, meaning you -
or more precisely: your team -
can choose whether you want to adhere to it.
This applies equally to in-house developers, partners, and customers.

We believe that clean code comes from the heart, not from pressure.

## Continuous Release

This guide is updated **continuously**,
meaning any change is reviewed and immediately put "live",
without special publication versions.

As programming languages and our understanding of them evolve,
we believe that these guides are "work in progress"
and will probably never see a status "finished";
as agile developers, we welcome this.

## Open Source

This repository is **open source**,
meaning it is written by a loose community of interested persons,
and anybody from within and without SAP is invited to contribute.

[LICENSE](../LICENSE) describes how you may use this material,
while [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) describes how you can contribute.

We believe that clean code should be discussed freely and openly.

## Grassroots Project

These guides are **grassroots projects**, meaning they were started,
and are still driven, by programmers who spend their day coding,
and want to get better at it.

We are developers, architects, quality engineers, and consultants,
from associates to chief experts, from language creators to tool developers,
from S/4HANA to the ABAP language group.
We respect all roles, ranks, and units,
and welcome any suggestions and improvements.
